It seems like you're referencing something with the phrase "Car Continued" but without additional context, I'm not sure what you are referring to. If you're referencing a car model, a topic about cars, or a previous conversation, please provide more details or information, so that I can help you in a more specific and informed manner.

> Here is my Action def action\_open\_customer\_details\_wizard(self): view\_id = self.env.ref('tk\_vehicle\_repair.customer\_details\_wizard\_form\_view').id return { 'name': 'Customer Details', 'type': 'ir.actions.act\_window', 'res\_model': 'customer.details.wizard', 'view\_mode': 'form', 'view\_id': view\_id, 'target': 'new', 'context': {'active\_id': self.id}, }

This piece of code appears to be a method written in Python and designed to be used in Odoo, a popular open-source ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software.

Let's break down this method:

1.  `def action_open_customer_details_wizard(self):` - Defines a new method named `action_open_customer_details_wizard`. It takes `self` as a parameter which is a common practice in object-oriented programming in Python. It refers to the instance of the class in which this method is defined.
    
2.  `view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.customer_details_wizard_form_view').id` - This line retrieves the view ID associated with the customer details wizard form. `self.env.ref` is an Odoo function that is used to reference a record in the database by its XML ID. The XML ID passed as a parameter ('tk\_vehicle\_repair.customer\_details\_wizard\_form\_view') is likely defined in one of the module's XML files. The `.id` at the end gets the ID of that record.
    
3.  `return { ... }` - The method returns a dictionary. This dictionary is used to open a form view in Odoo. Here's what each key-value pair does:
    
    *   `'name': 'Customer Details',` - This sets the title of the window to "Customer Details".
    *   `'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',` - Specifies the type of action, in this case, it is an action that opens a window.
    *   `'res_model': 'customer.details.wizard',` - Specifies the model that the form view should display. In this case, it's 'customer.details.wizard'.
    *   `'view_mode': 'form',` - Sets the view mode to 'form', meaning it will display the record(s) in a form view.
    *   `'view_id': view_id,` - Uses the previously retrieved view ID to specify which form view should be used.
    *   `'target': 'new',` - Opens the view in a new dialog rather than in the current view.
    *   `'context': {'active_id': self.id},` - Passes context information to the view. This is often used to pass default values or other information. In this case, it passes the active record's ID under the key 'active\_id'.

This method is likely used as a button or action within the Odoo interface to open a form for entering or editing customer details related to vehicle repair.

> yes it open a form wuth customer details which is all ready on the job card. but wehn I save the wizard it does not fill in the customer details in the job card

In Odoo, when you save a record from a wizard, it doesn't automatically update another record unless you specifically instruct it to do so through the code. To update the customer details in the job card, you will need to write the logic for it in the `customer.details.wizard` model. Here's an example that demonstrates how you could achieve this:

1.  Define a method in the `customer.details.wizard` model which will be called when the save button is pressed on the wizard. This method should update the related job card record with the details entered in the wizard.

Example:

python

```python
class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    # Fields for customer details
    customer_name = fields.Char()
    customer_address = fields.Char()
    # any other fields

    @api.multi
    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['your.job.card.model'].browse(active_id)
            # Here update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'customer_name': self.customer_name,
                'customer_address': self.customer_address,
                # ... other fields
            })
```

2.  Make sure that this method (`button_save_details`) is called when the save button is pressed. You can do this by adding it as the handler for the button in the wizard's form view XML.

Example:

xml

```xml
<button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
```

This example shows you how you can take the customer details from the wizard and update the job card with those details. Make sure to replace placeholder names like `'your.job.card.model'` with the actual model names and field names that you are using. Also, ensure the appropriate permissions are set in Odoo for the user roles that will be executing these actions.

> this is my wizard from odoo import fields, models class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel): \_name = 'customer.details.wizard' \_description = 'Customer Details Wizard' customer\_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer') phone = fields.Char(string="Phone") email = fields.Char(string="Email")

Given your `CustomerDetailsWizard` class which has fields `customer_id`, `phone`, and `email`, let's modify this class to include a method to save the details to the job card.

First, you should add a method in this class that is going to be executed when the save button is pressed. This method will write the customer details from the wizard to the job card record.

Here is how your modified class might look:

python

```python
from odoo import api, fields, models

class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    phone = fields.Char(string="Phone")
    email = fields.Char(string="Email")

    @api.multi
    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['your.job.card.model'].browse(active_id)
            # Here update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'customer_id': self.customer_id.id,
                'phone': self.phone,
                'email': self.email,
            })
```

Note: Please replace `'your.job.card.model'` with the actual name of your job card model.

Now, you need to ensure that this method (`button_save_details`) is called when the save button is pressed in the wizard. This can be done by specifying it as the handler for the button in the wizard's form view XML. For example:

xml

```xml
<button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
```

Make sure that this button is inside the form view XML of your wizard, and that the field names used in the `write` method match the actual field names in your job card model.

> its job\_card.py

Thank you for providing the name of the model (`job_card`). I will modify the code accordingly.

Here is how your `CustomerDetailsWizard` class should look like with the modified method that writes the customer details from the wizard to the `job_card` record:

python

```python
from odoo import api, fields, models

class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    phone = fields.Char(string="Phone")
    email = fields.Char(string="Email")

    @api.multi
    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job_card'].browse(active_id)
            # Here update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'customer_id': self.customer_id.id,
                'phone': self.phone,
                'email': self.email,
            })
```

And here is how the button in the XML should look like:

xml

```xml
<button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
```

Make sure that the field names (e.g. `'customer_id'`, `'phone'`, `'email'`) used in the `write` method match the actual field names in your `job_card` model.

This code should now save the data from the wizard to the `job_card` when the save button is pressed. If there is any specific field in the `job_card` model that should be updated with a different name or data type, make sure to modify the dictionary inside the `write` method accordingly.

> please remober odoo16 code practices there is no @api.multi in Odoo 16

You're correct, starting from Odoo 13, the `@api.multi` decorator is no longer needed as it is the default behavior. Since you are working with Odoo 16, let's update the code to reflect the best practices for that version.

Here's how your `CustomerDetailsWizard` class should look like without the `@api.multi` decorator:

python

```python
from odoo import fields, models

class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    phone = fields.Char(string="Phone")
    email = fields.Char(string="Email")

    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job_card'].browse(active_id)
            # Here update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'customer_id': self.customer_id.id,
                'phone': self.phone,
                'email': self.email,
            })
```

And, the XML button configuration remains the same:

xml

```xml
<button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
```

This code should work with Odoo 16 practices. As always, make sure that the field names in the `write` method match the field names in your `job_card` model.

> File "C:\\odoo16\\server\\odoo\\modules\\registry.py", line 186, in \_\_getitem\_\_ return self.models\[model\_name\] KeyError: 'job\_card'

The error message you're receiving indicates that Odoo is unable to find a model with the name `'job_card'`. This could be because the model is actually named differently, or it hasn't been properly registered.

Please make sure that the model name you are using in the code is exactly the same as it is defined in your module. The model name should be in lowercase and use dots (`.`) as separators (Odoo convention).

For example, if your model is defined as:

python

```python
class JobCard(models.Model):
    _name = 'your_module_name.job_card'
    _description = 'Job Card'

    # Fields for the job card model
```

Then, in the `CustomerDetailsWizard` class, you should use the exact same name when you are trying to browse the job card:

python

```python
job_card = self.env['your_module_name.job_card'].browse(active_id)
```

Make sure to replace `your_module_name.job_card` with the actual name of your job card model.

Also, ensure that your job card model is imported in the `__init__.py` file of your module, so that Odoo registers it correctly.

Thank you for providing the `job_card.py` file. The `_name` attribute of the model is `'job.card'`. Therefore, in the wizard, you should use `'job.card'` instead of `'job_card'` when you are trying to browse the job card.

Here is how your modified `CustomerDetailsWizard` class should look:

python

```python
from odoo import fields, models

class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    phone = fields.Char(string="Phone")
    email = fields.Char(string="Email")

    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
            # Here update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'customer_id': self.customer_id.id,
                'phone': self.phone,
                'email': self.email,
            })
```

And the XML configuration for the save button stays the same:

xml

```xml
<button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
```

This should now correctly update the `job.card` record with the details provided in the wizard when the Save button is clicked. Make sure that you have the right permissions and that there are no other conflicting modules that might cause an issue.

> That works but afer sacing the job card and editint if I click on open wizard the feilds are black. the wizard should show what is saved in job card also. We can change and edit customer from wizard also. Do that make sense? Do yo uunderstand

Yes, I understand. You want the wizard to show the existing customer details from the job card when you open it, so that you can edit them if needed.

To achieve this, you need to modify the context passed to the wizard to include the current values of the customer details from the job card. You can pass these details in the context, and in the wizard, you can use the `default_get` method to set default values for the fields based on the context.

Here is how you can modify your `action_open_customer_details_wizard` method in `job_card.py`:

python

```python
def action_open_customer_details_wizard(self):
    view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.customer_details_wizard_form_view').id
    return {
        'name': 'Customer Details',
        'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
        'res_model': 'customer.details.wizard',
        'view_mode': 'form',
        'view_id': view_id,
        'target': 'new',
        'context': {
            'default_customer_id': self.customer_id.id,
            'default_phone': self.phone,
            'default_email': self.email,
            'active_id': self.id
        },
    }
```

Next, you can modify your `CustomerDetailsWizard` class to include the `default_get` method that will use these default values from the context:

python

```python
from odoo import fields, models, api

class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    phone = fields.Char(string="Phone")
    email = fields.Char(string="Email")

    @api.model
    def default_get(self, fields_list):
        # Get the default values from the context
        defaults = super(CustomerDetailsWizard, self).default_get(fields_list)
        defaults['customer_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_customer_id')
        defaults['phone'] = self.env.context.get('default_phone')
        defaults['email'] = self.env.context.get('default_email')
        return defaults

    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
            # Update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'customer_id': self.customer_id.id,
                'phone': self.phone,
                'email': self.email,
            })
```

With these changes, when you open the wizard, it will show the current values from the job card. You can then edit these values and save them back to the job card.

> on the customer details wizard there is a Save & Discard button on th efooter. In the header we have the Save button which works. But one in the Footer does not. I want to replace the Save button in the header to the footer. Do you understand

Yes, I understand. The Save & Discard buttons in the footer are standard Odoo buttons for transient models. The Save button in the header is a custom button that you have added through the XML view. To replace the Save button in the header with the one in the footer, you'll need to attach the action method to the standard Save button in the footer.

To do this, you need to modify the XML view that defines your wizard form. Instead of adding a custom button in the header, you will bind the action to the standard Save button in the footer.

Here's how you can define your XML view. Note that you don't have to add a custom Save button. Just use the `save` special value for the `string` attribute and `object` value for the `type` attribute in the `footer` section:

xml

```xml
<record id="customer_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">customer.details.wizard.form</field>
    <field name="model">customer.details.wizard</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <group>
                <!-- Add your fields here, for example -->
                <field name="customer_id"/>
                <field name="phone"/>
                <field name="email"/>
            </group>
            <footer>
                <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
            </footer>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

This way, the Save button in the footer will call the `button_save_details` method from your `CustomerDetailsWizard` class, and the Cancel button will close the wizard without saving.

> I have renamed the open wizard button to Customer and it works great. I want to do the very same now wiht a new button called Vehicle and in the wizard use all the feilds from the vecheile dection. have you got all the feilds you need and do ou understand my requirement

2 / 2

Sure, I understand your requirement. You want to create another button, similar to the "Customer" button, but this one will be called "Vehicle". Clicking on this button will open a wizard where you can edit the vehicle details.

To do this, you'll need to create a new transient model (wizard) similar to `customer.details.wizard`, but for the vehicle fields.

Here's an example of how the new wizard might look:

python

```python
class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'

    vehicle_brand_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Name")
    vehicle_model_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model",
                                       domain="[('vehicle_brand_id', '=', vehicle_brand_id)]")
    reg_no = fields.Char(string="Registration Number")
    chassis_no = fields.Char(string="Chassis Number")
    vin_no = fields.Char(string="VIN Number")
    engine_no = fields.Char(string="Engine Number")
    kms_reading = fields.Integer(string="KMS Reading")

    @api.model
    def default_get(self, fields_list):
        # Get the default values from the context
        defaults = super(VehicleDetailsWizard, self).default_get(fields_list)
        defaults['vehicle_brand_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_brand_id')
        defaults['vehicle_model_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_model_id')
        defaults['reg_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_reg_no')
        defaults['chassis_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_chassis_no')
        defaults['vin_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_vin_no')
        defaults['engine_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_engine_no')
        defaults['kms_reading'] = self.env.context.get('default_kms_reading')
        return defaults

    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
            # Update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
                'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
                'reg_no': self.reg_no,
                'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
                'vin_no': self.vin_no,
                'engine_no': self.engine_no,
                'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            })
```

Next, you would create the "Vehicle" button in `job_card.py`:

python

```python
def action_open_vehicle_details_wizard(self):
    view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view').id
    return {
        'name': 'Vehicle Details',
        'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
        'res_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard',
        'view_mode': 'form',
        'view_id': view_id,
        'target': 'new',
        'context': {
            'default_vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'default_vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'default_reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'default_chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'default_vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'default_engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'default_kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'active_id': self.id
        },
    }
```

The form view would be similar to the one for `customer.details.wizard`. Don't forget to replace `'tk_vehicle_repair.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view'` with the actual XML ID of the view you create. Also, make sure you update your XML files and views to include the new wizard and action.

> can you give form vei also

Certainly, below is an example of the XML form view for the `vehicle.details.wizard`.

Create a new XML file or add the following content to one of your existing XML files:

xml

```xml
<record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
    <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <group>
                <field name="vehicle_brand_id"/>
                <field name="vehicle_model_id"/>
                <field name="reg_no"/>
                <field name="chassis_no"/>
                <field name="vin_no"/>
                <field name="engine_no"/>
                <field name="kms_reading"/>
            </group>
            <footer>
                <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
            </footer>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

This defines a form view for the `vehicle.details.wizard` transient model. Similar to the Customer Details Wizard, it contains fields for the vehicle details and a footer with Save and Cancel buttons. The Save button is configured to call the `button_save_details` method on the transient model, which should update the vehicle details in the job card.

Lastly, don't forget to add this XML file to your module's `__manifest__.py` file if it's a new file. And, you'll also need to make sure that this new wizard is properly registered and loaded by Odoo by updating your module in the Odoo apps list.

> where is the button

In order to add the "Vehicle" button to the job card form view, you need to modify the XML file that defines the `job.card` form view. Add a new button alongside the "Customer" button that calls the `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` method when clicked.

Here's an example of how you can modify the XML for the `job.card` form view:

xml

```xml
<record id="view_job_card_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">job.card.form</field>
    <field name="model">job.card</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <header>
                <!-- Here, add the new button called "Vehicle" -->
                <button string="Vehicle" type="object" class="oe_highlight" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard"/>
                <!-- Existing Customer Button -->
                <button string="Customer" type="object" class="oe_highlight" name="action_open_customer_details_wizard"/>
            </header>
            
            <!-- Rest of the form content -->
            
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

Please note that the above XML snippet is an example and may need to be adjusted based on the existing content of your `job.card` form view XML. The important part is to add the button with `string="Vehicle"` and `name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard"` in the appropriate place in your form view. The `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` should be the name of the method you defined in your `job_card.py` file that opens the Vehicle Details Wizard.

> api is not defiend

I apologize for that. It looks like I mistakenly included `@api.model` in the Python code snippet which is not used in Odoo version 14 onwards. Please remove that decorator, and let's make the method compliant with the new ORM.

Here is the updated `VehicleDetailsWizard` class without the `@api.model` decorator:

python

```python
from odoo import models, fields

class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'

    vehicle_brand_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Name")
    vehicle_model_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model",
                                       domain="[('vehicle_brand_id', '=', vehicle_brand_id)]")
    reg_no = fields.Char(string="Registration Number")
    chassis_no = fields.Char(string="Chassis Number")
    vin_no = fields.Char(string="VIN Number")
    engine_no = fields.Char(string="Engine Number")
    kms_reading = fields.Integer(string="KMS Reading")

    def default_get(self, fields_list):
        # Get the default values from the context
        defaults = super(VehicleDetailsWizard, self).default_get(fields_list)
        defaults['vehicle_brand_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_brand_id')
        defaults['vehicle_model_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_model_id')
        defaults['reg_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_reg_no')
        defaults['chassis_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_chassis_no')
        defaults['vin_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_vin_no')
        defaults['engine_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_engine_no')
        defaults['kms_reading'] = self.env.context.get('default_kms_reading')
        return defaults

    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
            # Update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
                'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
                'reg_no': self.reg_no,
                'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
                'vin_no': self.vin_no,
                'engine_no': self.engine_no,
                'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            })
```

This updated class should work properly in Odoo 16.

Certainly, I will help you update the view. But first, let me clarify that the view you've given is for `customer.details.wizard`. Since you wanted to create a new wizard for vehicle details, you should create a new view for that. Below, I am giving you an updated XML for `vehicle.details.wizard`. If you were referring to updating the existing customer details wizard, please let me know, and I will help accordingly.

Create a new XML file or add the following content to one of your existing XML files:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <group>
                        <!-- Add your fields for vehicle details here -->
                        <field name="vehicle_brand_id"/>
                        <field name="vehicle_model_id"/>
                        <field name="reg_no"/>
                        <field name="chassis_no"/>
                        <field name="vin_no"/>
                        <field name="engine_no"/>
                        <field name="kms_reading"/>
                    </group>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This XML file defines a form view for the `vehicle.details.wizard` transient model with fields for vehicle details and a footer with Save and Cancel buttons. Please make sure that this XML file is included in your module's `__manifest__.py` file if it's a new file. Additionally, don't forget to update your module in the Odoo apps list so that this new wizard and its view are properly registered and loaded by Odoo.

> i though i cound add vechile details to customer xml but i underatnad now. so i create a new xml copt the anove code and then add it to manifest

Yes, exactly! The Vehicle Details Wizard should have its own XML file for the form view since it is a different wizard from the Customer Details Wizard. Each wizard should have its own form view so they can be opened separately and handle different sets of fields.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1.  Create a new XML file for the Vehicle Details Wizard view (e.g., `vehicle_details_wizard_view.xml`).
    
2.  Copy the XML code I provided in my previous response to this new file.
    
3.  Update the `__manifest__.py` file of your module to include this new XML file. You should add the path to this file in the `'data'` list. For example:
    

python

```python
# __manifest__.py
{
    'name': 'Your Module Name',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Category',
    'description': """Your module description""",
    'depends': ['base'],
    'data': [
        # ... other XML files ...
        'views/vehicle_details_wizard_view.xml',  # Add the path to your new XML file here
    ],
    'installable': True,
}
```

4.  After making these changes, you need to upgrade your module in Odoo. Go to the Apps menu, search for your module, and click on the "Upgrade" button.

By following these steps, your module will now have a new wizard for Vehicle Details with its own form view.

> ValueError: External ID not found in the system: tk\_vehicle\_repair.vehicle\_details\_wizard\_form\_view

This error is occurring because Odoo is not able to find the view with the external ID `tk_vehicle_repair.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view`.

This usually happens if:

1.  The XML file containing the view definition is not properly referenced in the module's `__manifest__.py` file.
2.  There is a typo in the XML ID or in the reference to it.
3.  The module has not been updated after adding the new view.

Here are steps to resolve this issue:

1.  Ensure that the XML file containing the view is properly added in the `__manifest__.py` file under the `data` section. For example, if the XML file is named `vehicle_details_wizard_view.xml` and is in the `views` directory, make sure it’s added like this:

python

```python
# __manifest__.py
{
    ...
    'data': [
        ...
        'views/vehicle_details_wizard_view.xml', # add this line
    ],
    ...
}
```

2.  Make sure that the XML ID is correct. In the XML file, ensure that the `id` attribute for the `record` is set as `vehicle_details_wizard_form_view`:

xml

```xml
<record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    ...
</record>
```

3.  Update the module. Go to the Apps menu in Odoo, remove the "Apps" filter, search for your module by its name, and click on the "Upgrade" button. This step is necessary every time you make changes to the module's files.
    
4.  If you're referencing this view in code (e.g., in a Python file), make sure you're using the correct full external ID, which includes the module name. For example:
    

python

```python
view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view').id
```

After following these steps, the issue should be resolved.

> we have to add to csv here is example tk\_vehicle\_repair.access\_vehicle\_repair\_dashboard\_receptionist,access\_vehicle\_repair\_dashboard\_receptionist,tk\_vehicle\_repair.model\_vehicle\_repair\_dashboard,tk\_vehicle\_repair.workshop\_receptionist,1,1,1,1 tk\_vehicle\_repair.access\_customer\_details\_wizard\_manager,Access Customer Details Wizard Manager,tk\_vehicle\_repair.model\_customer\_details\_wizard,tk\_vehicle\_repair.workshop\_manager,1,1,1,1

If you have to add the view to an access control list through CSV, it sounds like you need to add the access rights for the new wizard to the security file.

In Odoo, you can define access rights using a CSV file. This is commonly done in a file named `ir.model.access.csv` which is located in the `security` directory of the module.

1.  Inside your module, find or create the `security` directory.
    
2.  Inside the `security` directory, create or edit the file `ir.model.access.csv`.
    
3.  Add the access rights for the new wizard, similar to what you did for the customer details wizard. You need to provide the access rights for the model `vehicle.details.wizard`.
    

Example of what you should add to `ir.model.access.csv`:

csv

```csv
id,name,model_id:id,group_id:id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink
tk_vehicle_repair.access_vehicle_details_wizard_manager,Access Vehicle Details Wizard Manager,tk_vehicle_repair.model_vehicle_details_wizard,tk_vehicle_repair.workshop_manager,1,1,1,1
```

4.  Make sure the `ir.model.access.csv` file is referenced in your module's `__manifest__.py` file. For example:

python

```python
# __manifest__.py
{
    ...
    'data': [
        ...
        'security/ir.model.access.csv',
    ],
    ...
}
```

5.  Finally, upgrade your module in Odoo by going to the Apps menu, remove the "Apps" filter, search for your module by its name, and click on the "Upgrade" button.

This should set up the appropriate permissions for the new Vehicle Details Wizard.

> That worked, I am trying to learn all about ODoo 16 wizards. i inderstand wizards needs to use (models.TransientModel): so it can save teh wizard to database. please correct me if i am wrong but from all of the aobve chat can you create a dociment expkainf everthing ewe did. This is what i think we did we create a button. A button needs an action for it to work each action is defined by a class. Not really sure anbout classes. can you elain all in simple terms for begineer.

Certainly! Odoo is a powerful and feature-rich ERP system. It uses Python programming language and provides a framework for developers to build custom modules and features. Wizards in Odoo are dialog screens that are used to guide users through a multi-step process or to collect additional information before performing an action.

Here is a simplified explanation of everything we did:

1.  **Models**: In Odoo, a model is like a table in a database. It holds data for different records. For example, a model can represent customers, products, or invoices. Models are created by defining Python classes that inherit from either `models.Model` for regular data (persisted in the database) or `models.TransientModel` for temporary data that doesn't need to be stored long-term (wizards).
    
2.  **Fields**: Inside a model, you can define fields. Fields are like columns in a database table. For example, a customer model might have fields for name, address, and email.
    
3.  **Views**: Views define how the data from models is presented to the user. There are different types of views like form views, list views, and kanban views. Form views are used for creating and editing individual records.
    
4.  **Wizards**: In Odoo, wizards are used for intermediate steps in a process. They are created using Transient Models (`models.TransientModel`). This means they are temporary and not meant to be stored in the database permanently.
    
5.  **Buttons**: Buttons are UI elements that can trigger actions. In Odoo, buttons can be added in views and are usually linked to Python methods in the model.
    
6.  **Actions**: Actions define what should happen when a user interacts with something in Odoo, like clicking a button.
    

Now, let's go through the steps we took:

1.  **Define a Wizard Model**: We defined a new wizard model by creating a Python class that inherits from `models.TransientModel`. We added fields to this model that we wanted to show in the wizard. Example: Customer name, email.
    
2.  **Create a View for the Wizard**: We created an XML file defining a form view for this new wizard model. In this view, we added fields that we want to display in the wizard. We also added buttons like "Save" and "Cancel" in the footer section.
    
3.  **Define a Button in the Main Model**: We added a button in the main model (Job Card) by editing its form view. This button is used to open the wizard.
    
4.  **Create an Action Method for the Button**: In the main model's Python file, we defined a method (action) which is executed when the button is clicked. This method returns an action dictionary that tells Odoo to open the wizard.
    
5.  **Handling the Save Operation in the Wizard**: We defined a method in the wizard model to handle the save operation. When the "Save" button is clicked, this method is responsible for taking the data from the wizard and updating the corresponding record in the main model (Job Card).
    
6.  **Security and Access Rights**: We defined access rights for the new wizard model in the `ir.model.access.csv` file so that users have the necessary permissions to interact with it.
    
7.  **Update Module Manifest**: We updated the `__manifest__.py` file to include references to the new files (Python and XML) we created.
    
8.  **Upgrade the Module**: Finally, we upgraded the module in Odoo to reflect all the changes we made.
    

This is a simplified overview of the process. Odoo can be complex, but once you understand the basic concepts and how they relate to each other, it becomes much easier to develop custom modules and features.

> I want to create a new button and the button is called Start, When you click Start you get vehecile wizard

Certainly! To add a new button called "Start" that opens a vehicle wizard, you will need to follow similar steps as we did before. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Define a new Wizard Model for Vehicle Details**: First, create a new Python file (e.g., `vehicle_wizard.py`) in your module's models directory. In this file, define a new model for the wizard by creating a class that inherits from `models.TransientModel`. Define fields that you want to show in the vehicle wizard (e.g., brand, model, chassis number, etc.).

Example:

python

```python
from odoo import models, fields

class VehicleWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Wizard'

    vehicle_brand_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Brand")
    vehicle_model_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model")
    chassis_no = fields.Char(string="Chassis Number")
    # ... other fields ...

    def button_save_details(self):
        # Logic to save the details from the wizard to the job card
        # ...
```

2.  **Create a Form View for the Vehicle Wizard**: Next, create a new XML file (e.g., `vehicle_wizard_view.xml`) in your module's views directory. Define a form view for the vehicle wizard model. Add fields and buttons similar to the customer wizard view.

Example:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <record id="vehicle_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">vehicle.wizard.form</field>
        <field name="model">vehicle.wizard</field>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <form>
                <group>
                    <field name="vehicle_brand_id"/>
                    <field name="vehicle_model_id"/>
                    <field name="chassis_no"/>
                    <!-- ... other fields ... -->
                </group>
                <footer>
                    <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                    <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                </footer>
            </form>
        </field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

3.  **Add the "Start" Button to the Job Card View**: Update the job card's form view XML file to add a new button called "Start".
    
4.  **Define an Action Method for the "Start" Button**: In the `job_card.py` file, define a method that is executed when the "Start" button is clicked. This method should return an action dictionary similar to the customer wizard, but referencing the vehicle wizard view.
    

Example:

python

```python
def action_open_vehicle_wizard(self):
    view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.vehicle_wizard_form_view').id
    return {
        'name': 'Vehicle Details',
        'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
        'res_model': 'vehicle.wizard',
        'view_mode': 'form',
        'view_id': view_id,
        'target': 'new',
        'context': {'active_id': self.id},
    }
```

5.  **Add Security and Access Rights**: Similar to what we did before, add the access rights for the new vehicle wizard in the `ir.model.access.csv` file.
    
6.  **Update Module Manifest**: Update the `__manifest__.py` file to include references to the new Python and XML files you created.
    
7.  **Upgrade the Module in Odoo**: Finally, upgrade the module in Odoo to see the new "Start" button and the vehicle wizard.
    

> we already have the wizard

I apologize for the confusion. If you already have the wizard created, you will just need to create the button and define its action. Here are the simplified steps:

1.  **Add the "Start" Button to the Job Card View**: Update the job card's form view XML file to add a new button called "Start". You'll bind this button to a method that you'll define in the next step.
    
2.  **Define an Action Method for the "Start" Button**: In the `job_card.py` file, define a method that is executed when the "Start" button is clicked. This method should return an action dictionary similar to the customer wizard, but referencing the vehicle wizard view.
    

Here’s how you can add the button to the job card view (assuming you want it to be at the top of the form similar to the "Customer" button):

Add this within the `form` tag of your job card's form view XML:

xml

```xml
<header>
    <button string="Start" type="object" class="oe_highlight" name="action_open_vehicle_wizard"/>
</header>
```

Here’s how you can define the action method in `job_card.py`:

python

```python
def action_open_vehicle_wizard(self):
    view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view').id  # Make sure to use the correct external ID for your vehicle wizard form view
    return {
        'name': 'Vehicle Details',
        'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
        'res_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard',  # Use the correct model name for your vehicle wizard
        'view_mode': 'form',
        'view_id': view_id,
        'target': 'new',
        'context': {'active_id': self.id},
    }
```

Make sure to use the correct external ID for your vehicle wizard form view and the correct model name for your vehicle wizard in the action method.

After you make these changes, update the module in Odoo, and you should see the new "Start" button on the job card. When clicked, it should open the vehicle wizard.

> I want to add the image yo the vechicle wizard </header> <sheet> <div class="oe\_button\_box" name="button\_box" position="inside" groups="tk\_vehicle\_repair.workshop\_manager"> <button class="oe\_stat\_button" type="object" name="action\_view\_sale\_order" icon="fa-money"> <field string="Sale Order" name="total\_sale\_amount" widget="statinfo"/> <field name="sale\_order\_id" invisible="1"/> <field name="currency\_id" invisible="1"/> <field name="company\_id" invisible="1"/> </button> </div> <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe\_avatar" nolabel="1"/> <div class="oe\_title"> <!-- This is the new outer group that will contain two sub-groups --> <group> <!-- This is the first sub-group for "Job Card Number" and "Date" --> <group> <h1> <field name="job\_card\_number"/> </h1> <label for="date"/> <h3> <field name="date" class="job\_date\_class"/> </h3> </group>

To add the image to the vehicle wizard, you'll need to make sure the image field is included in the model for the vehicle wizard and then you'll have to add it to the wizard's form view.

First, make sure the wizard model (`vehicle.details.wizard`) has a field for the image. This would be in your `vehicle_details_wizard.py` (or the equivalent file where the wizard model is defined):

python

```python
from odoo import fields, models

class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'
    
    # Other fields here ...
    
    avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image")
```

Now, update the XML view of the vehicle wizard to include the image field. This would be in your `vehicle_details_wizard_view.xml` file (or the equivalent file where the wizard view is defined):

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <sheet>
                        <div class="oe_title">
                            <!-- Add the image -->
                            <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>

                            <!-- Add your other fields here, for example -->
                            <group>
                                <!-- ... Other fields ... -->
                            </group>
                        </div>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This XML code places the image at the top of the form. You can adjust the size by changing the values in the `options` attribute of the `field` tag.

> here is my veiw <odoo> <data> <record id="vehicle\_details\_wizard\_form\_view" model="ir.ui.view"> <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field> <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field> <field name="arch" type="xml"> <form> <group> <!-- Add your fields for vehicle details here --> <field name="vehicle\_brand\_id"/> <field name="vehicle\_model\_id"/> <field name="reg\_no"/> <field name="chassis\_no"/> <field name="vin\_no"/> <field name="engine\_no"/> <field name="kms\_reading"/> </group> <footer> <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button\_save\_details"/> <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/> </footer> </form> </field> </record> </data> </odoo>

You can add the image field to your existing view. Just make sure you have defined the image field (`avatar`) in the `vehicle.details.wizard` model like I mentioned earlier.

Here's the modified XML view which includes the image field at the top of the form:

xml

            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>

                            <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                            <!-- Vehicle Details Group -->

                                <field name="vehicle_model_id"/>
                                <field name="reg_no"/>
                                <field name="chassis_no"/>
                                <field name="vin_no"/>
                                <field name="engine_no"/>
                                <field name="kms_reading"/>
                            </group>
                        </div>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This code adds the image above the other fields in the vehicle details wizard. As mentioned earlier, make sure the `avatar` field is defined in your `vehicle.details.wizard` model.

> image from wizard is not saved to jobcard

To save the image from the wizard to the job card, you need to update the image field (`avatar`) on the job card with the value from the wizard when the save button is clicked.

First, ensure that the `vehicle.details.wizard` model has a field to store the image (`avatar`).

Next, in your wizard's Python code, modify the save button method (which might be named something like `button_save_details`) to also update the `avatar` field on the job card.

Here's an example of what the save button method might look like:

python

```python
# Inside vehicle.details.wizard model

def button_save_details(self):
    # You should already have code here to save other details to the job card,
    # Add code to save the avatar image as well

    job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(self.env.context.get('active_id'))

    # Save avatar image to the job card
    job_card.avatar = self.avatar

    # Your existing code to save other details goes here...

    return {'type': 'ir.actions.act_window_close'}
```

This code assumes that the method `button_save_details` is defined in your `vehicle.details.wizard` model, and it's responsible for saving the details from the wizard to the job card. The method is updating the `avatar` field on the job card with the image from the wizard.

> my customer\_details\_wizard has the class for vechieles from odoo import fields, models class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel): \_name = 'customer.details.wizard' \_description = 'Customer Details Wizard' customer\_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer') phone = fields.Char(string="Phone") email = fields.Char(string="Email") def button\_save\_details(self): active\_id = self.env.context.get('active\_id') if active\_id: job\_card = self.env\['job.card'\].browse(active\_id) # Here update the job card with details from the wizard job\_card.write({ 'customer\_id': self.customer\_id.id, 'phone': self.phone, 'email': self.email, }) class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel): \_name = 'vehicle.details.wizard' \_description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard' avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image") vehicle\_brand\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Name") vehicle\_model\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model", domain="\[('vehicle\_brand\_id', '=', vehicle\_brand\_id)\]") reg\_no = fields.Char(string="Registration Number") chassis\_no = fields.Char(string="Chassis Number") vin\_no = fields.Char(string="VIN Number") engine\_no = fields.Char(string="Engine Number") kms\_reading = fields.Integer(string="KMS Reading") def default\_get(self, fields\_list): # Get the default values from the context defaults = super(VehicleDetailsWizard, self).default\_get(fields\_list) defaults\['vehicle\_brand\_id'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_vehicle\_brand\_id') defaults\['vehicle\_model\_id'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_vehicle\_model\_id') defaults\['reg\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_reg\_no') defaults\['chassis\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_chassis\_no') defaults\['vin\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_vin\_no') defaults\['engine\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_engine\_no') defaults\['kms\_reading'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_kms\_reading') return defaults def button\_save\_details(self): active\_id = self.env.context.get('active\_id') if active\_id: job\_card = self.env\['job.card'\].browse(active\_id) # Update the job card with details from the wizard job\_card.write({ 'vehicle\_brand\_id': self.vehicle\_brand\_id.id, 'vehicle\_model\_id': self.vehicle\_model\_id.id, 'reg\_no': self.reg\_no, 'chassis\_no': self.chassis\_no, 'vin\_no': self.vin\_no, 'engine\_no': self.engine\_no, 'kms\_reading': self.kms\_reading, })

Your code looks good. Now, let's add the code for saving the image (avatar) from the wizard to the job card within the `button_save_details` method of the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class:

python

```python
from odoo import fields, models

class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    phone = fields.Char(string="Phone")
    email = fields.Char(string="Email")

    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
            # Here update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'customer_id': self.customer_id.id,
                'phone': self.phone,
                'email': self.email,
            })

class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'

    avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image")
    vehicle_brand_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Name")
    vehicle_model_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model",
                                       domain="[('vehicle_brand_id', '=', vehicle_brand_id)]")
    reg_no = fields.Char(string="Registration Number")
    chassis_no = fields.Char(string="Chassis Number")
    vin_no = fields.Char(string="VIN Number")
    engine_no = fields.Char(string="Engine Number")
    kms_reading = fields.Integer(string="KMS Reading")

    def default_get(self, fields_list):
        # Get the default values from the context
        defaults = super(VehicleDetailsWizard, self).default_get(fields_list)
        defaults['vehicle_brand_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_brand_id')
        defaults['vehicle_model_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_model_id')
        defaults['reg_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_reg_no')
        defaults['chassis_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_chassis_no')
        defaults['vin_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_vin_no')
        defaults['engine_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_engine_no')
        defaults['kms_reading'] = self.env.context.get('default_kms_reading')
        return defaults

    def button_save_details(self):
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
            # Update the job card with details from the wizard
            job_card.write({
                'avatar': self.avatar,
                'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
                'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
                'reg_no': self.reg_no,
                'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
                'vin_no': self.vin_no,
                'engine_no': self.engine_no,
                'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            })
```

The key change here is the inclusion of `'avatar': self.avatar,` inside the `write` method. This will update the image (avatar) of the job card with the image from the wizard when you click the Save button on the wizard.

> when I click new job card I now have 4 buttons Assign to Technician, Start, Vehicle, Customer Start should only show when no other feilds are filled in so only on New On New Start should be only button visible. does this make sene to the flow dow you understand

Yes, I understand that you want the "Start" button to be visible only when the job card is new, and none of its fields are filled in. Once the job card is started (presumably by clicking the "Start" button), you want the "Start" button to be hidden and the other buttons ("Assign to Technician", "Vehicle", "Customer") to be visible.

To achieve this in Odoo, you can use `attrs` to control the visibility of buttons based on the state of fields in the form. You might need to have a boolean field on your job card model, for example, `is_started`, which defaults to `False` and is set to `True` once the job is started (you will need to set this programmatically, likely in the code behind the "Start" button).

Here is an example to illustrate how this could be done in the form view XML:

xml

```xml
<record id="view_job_card_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">job.card.form</field>
    <field name="model">job.card</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <!-- Your form fields go here -->
            ...

            <header>
                <button string="Start" type="object" class="oe_highlight" name="action_start_job" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}" />
                <button string="Assign to Technician" type="object" name="action_assign_technician" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}" />
                <button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}" />
                <button string="Customer" type="object" name="action_open_customer_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}" />
            </header>

            ...
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

And, in your Python code, you will need to define the `action_start_job` method to set the `is_started` field to `True` when the "Start" button is clicked. For example:

python

```python
from odoo import api, fields, models

class JobCard(models.Model):
    _name = 'job.card'
    _description = 'Job Card'
    
    # Your fields here
    ...
    is_started = fields.Boolean(string="Is Started", default=False)
    ...
    
    # Method for the "Start" button
    @api.multi
    def action_start_job(self):
        self.write({'is_started': True})
```

This example assumes you have a boolean field called `is_started` on the `job.card` model. The `attrs` attribute in the XML sets the visibility of buttons based on the value of the `is_started` field. The "Start" button is invisible when `is_started` is `True`, and the other buttons are invisible when `is_started` is `False`.

> No there is a create button Before that. When you click create you go to job card where other buttons are. Start should be only visibe button here. When you click start you get the vechile wizard

Thank you for clarifying. I understand now that there is a "Create" button that leads you to a new Job Card, and on this new Job Card, the only button that should be visible initially is the "Start" button. Once the "Start" button is clicked, the Vehicle Wizard is shown, and after closing the wizard, other buttons should become visible on the Job Card.

To achieve this, you can still use a similar approach as before, but you need to use the boolean field (e.g., `is_started`) to track whether the "Start" button has been clicked.

1.  **Add a boolean field to the Job Card model**: This field (e.g., `is_started`) will help you track whether the Job Card has been started.
    
2.  **Modify the Job Card form view**: Use `attrs` to control the visibility of the buttons.
    
3.  **Modify the method associated with the "Start" button**: In this method, open the Vehicle Wizard, and once it is closed, set `is_started` to `True`.
    

Here is an example:

Python code:

python

```python
from odoo import api, fields, models

class JobCard(models.Model):
    _name = 'job.card'
    _description = 'Job Card'
    
    # Your fields here
    ...
    is_started = fields.Boolean(string="Is Started", default=False)
    ...

    # Method for the "Start" button
    def button_start(self):
        # Code to open the Vehicle Wizard goes here
        
        # After the wizard is closed, set is_started to True
        self.write({'is_started': True})
```

XML code:

xml

```xml
<record id="view_job_card_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">job.card.form</field>
    <field name="model">job.card</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <!-- Your form fields go here -->
            ...

            <header>
                <button string="Start" type="object" class="oe_highlight" name="button_start" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}" />
                <button string="Assign to Technician" type="object" name="action_assign_technician" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}" />
                <button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}" />
                <button string="Customer" type="object" name="action_open_customer_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}" />
            </header>

            ...
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

In this example, when a new Job Card is created, the `is_started` field is `False`, so only the "Start" button is visible. Once you click the "Start" button, the Vehicle Wizard should open (you will need to write the code to open the wizard), and after closing it, the `is_started` field is set to `True`, making the "Start" button invisible and the other buttons visible.

> action\_open\_vehicle\_wizard is not a valid action on job.card

I apologize for any confusion. The `action_open_vehicle_wizard` was just an example name for the action that should be triggered when you click the "Vehicle" button. You need to create this method within your `job.card` model in your python code to open the Vehicle Wizard.

Here's an example of how you could create this method in your `job.card` model to open the Vehicle Wizard:

python

```python
from odoo import api, fields, models, _

class JobCard(models.Model):
    _name = 'job.card'
    _description = 'Job Card'

    # Your fields here
    ...
    is_started = fields.Boolean(string="Is Started", default=False)
    ...

    # Method for the "Start" button
    def button_start(self):
        # Code to open the Vehicle Wizard goes here

        # After the wizard is closed, set is_started to True
        self.write({'is_started': True})

    # Method for the "Vehicle" button
    def action_open_vehicle_wizard(self):
        self.ensure_one()
        context = {
            'default_vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'default_vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            # Add other default fields here...
            'active_id': self.id,
        }
        return {
            'name': _('Vehicle Details'),
            'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
            'res_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard',
            'view_mode': 'form',
            'view_id': self.env.ref('your_module_name.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view').id,
            'target': 'new',
            'context': context,
        }
```

Make sure to replace `your_module_name` with the actual name of your module, and ensure that the rest of the method corresponds to how your module is structured.

This `action_open_vehicle_wizard` method should be called when the "Vehicle" button is clicked, and it should open the Vehicle Wizard with the fields pre-populated based on the current Job Card.

> action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard

It looks like you want to use a different method name: `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard`. In that case, you will need to make sure that the button in the XML view file calls this method when it is clicked.

Here's how the method would look in your `job.card` model (in python):

python

```python
from odoo import api, fields, models, _

class JobCard(models.Model):
    _name = 'job.card'
    _description = 'Job Card'

    # Your fields here
    ...
    is_started = fields.Boolean(string="Is Started", default=False)
    ...

    # Method for the "Start" button
    def button_start(self):
        # Code to open the Vehicle Wizard goes here

        # After the wizard is closed, set is_started to True
        self.write({'is_started': True})

    # Method for the "Vehicle" button
    def action_open_vehicle_details_wizard(self):
        self.ensure_one()
        context = {
            'default_vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'default_vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            # Add other default fields here...
            'active_id': self.id,
        }
        return {
            'name': _('Vehicle Details'),
            'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
            'res_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard',
            'view_mode': 'form',
            'view_id': self.env.ref('your_module_name.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view').id,
            'target': 'new',
            'context': context,
        }
```

And, in your XML view file, the button should be like this:

xml

```xml
<button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="btn-secondary"/>
```

Remember to replace `your_module_name` with the actual name of your module.

> in job card i already have this def action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard(self): view\_id = self.env.ref('tk\_vehicle\_repair.vehicle\_details\_wizard\_form\_view').id return { 'name': 'Vehicle Details', 'type': 'ir.actions.act\_window', 'res\_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard', 'view\_mode': 'form', 'view\_id': view\_id, 'target': 'new', 'context': { 'default\_vehicle\_brand\_id': self.vehicle\_brand\_id.id, 'default\_vehicle\_model\_id': self.vehicle\_model\_id.id, 'default\_reg\_no': self.reg\_no, 'default\_chassis\_no': self.chassis\_no, 'default\_vin\_no': self.vin\_no, 'default\_engine\_no': self.engine\_no, 'default\_kms\_reading': self.kms\_reading, 'active\_id': self.id }, }

It appears that you already have the `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` method in your job card model, which is excellent.

Now, let's ensure that your XML view file has the "Start" button configured correctly so it calls this method when clicked.

Here's an example of how the "Start" button should be coded in your XML view file:

xml

```xml
<button string="Start" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="btn-secondary" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}"/>
```

This example uses the `attrs` attribute to conditionally hide the "Start" button based on the value of the `is_started` field. This field should be a boolean that is set to `True` once the user has clicked the "Start" button and finished using the wizard. To set this boolean you can update it inside the method when you are saving details from the wizard to the job card.

Also, ensure that you have this field `is_started` in your model:

python

```python
is_started = fields.Boolean(string="Is Started", default=False)
```

You can set `is_started` to `True` in the `button_save_details` method of your wizard.

For example, in your `VehicleDetailsWizard` class:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })
```

The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the action named `action_open_vehicle_wizard`. The system is not recognizing it as a valid action in the `job.card` model.

Here are a few things to check:

1.  Ensure that the method `action_open_vehicle_wizard` is defined in the model associated with the job card, which should be `job.card`. If it's not, you should either define it or use the correct method name in the XML.
    
2.  Make sure that you don't have any typos in the method name.
    
3.  If you are trying to reference an action from a different model, make sure the method exists and is defined as public (no leading `_`).
    
4.  Make sure the model file where the method is defined is imported and declared in the `__init__.py` file.
    

If you meant to reference `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` instead of `action_open_vehicle_wizard`, then you need to update the XML with the correct method name:

xml

```xml
<button string="Start" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="btn-secondary" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}"/>
<button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}"/>
<button string="Customer" type="object" name="action_open_customer_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}"/>
```

Please verify the above points, and make sure the method names are correctly referenced in your XML file.

> def action\_open\_customer\_details\_wizard(self): view\_id = self.env.ref('tk\_vehicle\_repair.customer\_details\_wizard\_form\_view').id return { 'name': 'Customer Details', 'type': 'ir.actions.act\_window', 'res\_model': 'customer.details.wizard', 'view\_mode': 'form', 'view\_id': view\_id, 'target': 'new', 'context': { 'default\_customer\_id': self.customer\_id.id, 'default\_phone': self.phone, 'default\_email': self.email, 'active\_id': self.id }, } def action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard(self): view\_id = self.env.ref('tk\_vehicle\_repair.vehicle\_details\_wizard\_form\_view').id return { 'name': 'Vehicle Details', 'type': 'ir.actions.act\_window', 'res\_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard', 'view\_mode': 'form', 'view\_id': view\_id, 'target': 'new', 'context': { 'default\_vehicle\_brand\_id': self.vehicle\_brand\_id.id, 'default\_vehicle\_model\_id': self.vehicle\_model\_id.id, 'default\_reg\_no': self.reg\_no, 'default\_chassis\_no': self.chassis\_no, 'default\_vin\_no': self.vin\_no, 'default\_engine\_no': self.engine\_no, 'default\_kms\_reading': self.kms\_reading, 'active\_id': self.id }, } def in\_diagnosis(self): for rec in self: rec.task = 'b\_in\_diagnosis'

Given your current `job.card` model's methods, your job card XML view's button definitions should look like this:

xml

```xml
<button string="Start" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="btn-secondary" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}"/>
<button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}"/>
<button string="Customer" type="object" name="action_open_customer_details_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', False)]}"/>
```

Note that the method name you've provided for the "Vehicle" and "Start" buttons is `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` and for the "Customer" button, it's `action_open_customer_details_wizard`.

This configuration should work assuming that the `is_started` field is correctly updated in your business logic, and that it correctly represents when the buttons should be visible or not.

In this case:

*   The "Start" button will be invisible once `is_started` is `True`.
*   The "Vehicle" and "Customer" buttons will be invisible while `is_started` is `False`.

The actions these buttons call are `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` and `action_open_customer_details_wizard` respectively, which correspond to the methods you have defined in your `job.card` model. These methods will open up the respective wizard forms when the buttons are clicked.

Remember to update the views XML file and restart the Odoo server for the changes to take effect. Afterward, upgrade the module from the Odoo Apps list.

> <form \_\_validate\_\_="1"> <header> <field name="task" widget="statusbar"/> Field 'is\_started' used in attrs ({'invisible': \[('is\_started', '=', False)\]}) must be present in view but is missing. View error context: {'file': 'c:\\\\odoo16\\\\custom\\\\tk\_vehicle\_repair\\\\views\\\\job\_card\_views.xml', 'line': 1, 'name': 'job.card.form.view', 'view': ir.ui.view(1278,), 'view.model': 'job.card', 'view.parent': ir.ui.view(), 'xmlid': 'job\_card\_form\_view'}

The error message indicates that the field `is_started` which is being used in the `attrs` attribute of the button is not present in the view. The `attrs` attribute is used to change the properties of the field based on a condition.

To fix this, you will need to add the `is_started` field in your form view. It is not necessary for the field to be visible, you can keep it invisible if you don't want it to be shown to the users.

Add the following line inside the `<form>` tag, preferably before the `<header>`:

xml

```xml
<field name="is_started" invisible="1"/>
```

This will add the field to the view, but keep it hidden from the user. The `attrs` condition should now work properly.

Also, ensure that the `is_started` field actually exists in your model. If it doesn't, you will need to add it to your model. If `is_started` is supposed to be a boolean indicating whether the job card has started or not, you can define it in your model like this:

python

```python
is_started = fields.Boolean(string="Is Started", default=False)
```

After making these changes, don't forget to update the module in Odoo.

> it is in job\_card.py avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image") is\_started = fields.Boolean(string="Is Started", default=False) job\_card\_number = fields.Char(string='Job Card No', required=True, readonly=True, default=lambda self: ('New')) date = fields.Datetime(required=True, default=fields.Datetime.now) customer\_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer', required=False) phone = fields.Char(string="Phone") email = fields.Char(string="Email") vehicle\_brand\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Name", required=False) vehicle\_model\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model",

Okay, since the `is_started` field is present in your model, you just need to add it to the view (it can be invisible). This is required for the Odoo client to be aware of its existence, so that the `attrs` conditions can work properly.

Update your view XML by adding the `is_started` field inside the `<form>` tag before the `<header>`. It can be invisible, since it doesn't need to be displayed.

Here's how you can modify the view:

xml

```xml
<form>
    <!-- This line ensures that the is_started field is available in the view -->
    <field name="is_started" invisible="1"/>

    <header>
        <!-- ... rest of your header and buttons ... -->
    </header>
    <!-- ... rest of your form ... -->
</form>
```

Once you have made this change, you need to update the module in Odoo. This can be done through the Apps menu by searching for your module and clicking Update, or by using the command line:

sh

```sh
./odoo-bin -u module_name
```

Replace `module_name` with the name of your module.

> it works but O just have Text Start I lost the Button backgorund. When I click start it works but it does not stand out like a button

In Odoo, buttons within the form view's header typically don't have the same styling as buttons in the main content of the form. However, if you would like to give the "Start" button a distinctive style, you can try adding a class attribute to the button.

Odoo comes with several built-in button styles. For instance, you can use the `btn-primary` class to give the button a prominent color. Below is an example:

xml

```xml
<button string="Start" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="btn-primary" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}"/>
```

If you find that the `btn-primary` class doesn't apply, it could be because the buttons in the header section are generally styled differently by Odoo. In such cases, you can create custom styles using CSS.

First, create a CSS file within your module. For example, create a file named `static/src/css/custom_styles.css` and add custom styles for your button:

css

```css
.custom-start-button {
    background-color: blue; /* You can choose your own color */
    color: white;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

Then, add a reference to this CSS file in your module by creating an XML file that includes the link to the CSS. For example, create a file named `assets.xml` in your module's `views` folder:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/module_name/static/src/css/custom_styles.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Replace `module_name` with the name of your module.

Next, add this file to your module's `__manifest__.py` file:

python

```python
'data': [
    'views/assets.xml',
    # ... other files ...
],
```

Finally, assign the custom class to your button in the view XML:

xml

```xml
<button string="Start" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="custom-start-button" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}"/>
```

After making these changes, update your module in Odoo and you should see the custom styling applied to the "Start" button.

> module name is tk\_vehicle\_repair

Alright, I'll modify the examples to use `tk_vehicle_repair` as the module name.

1.  Create a CSS file within your module. For example, create a file named `static/src/css/custom_styles.css` in your `tk_vehicle_repair` module and add custom styles for your button:

css

```css
.custom-start-button {
    background-color: blue; /* You can choose your own color */
    color: white;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

2.  Add a reference to this CSS file in your module by creating an XML file that includes the link to the CSS. For example, create a file named `assets.xml` in your `tk_vehicle_repair` module's `views` folder:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/custom_styles.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

3.  Next, add this file to your module's `__manifest__.py` file:

python

```python
'data': [
    'views/assets.xml',
    # ... other files ...
],
```

4.  Finally, assign the custom class to your button in the view XML:

xml

```xml
<button string="Start" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="custom-start-button" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_started', '=', True)]}"/>
```

After making these changes, update your `tk_vehicle_repair` module in Odoo and you should see the custom styling applied to the "Start" button.

> I alrady have an assest.xml here is contents <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <odoo> <data> <record id="action\_vehicle\_repair\_dashboard" model="ir.actions.client"> <field name="name">Statistics</field> <field name="tag">vehicle\_repair\_dashboard</field> </record> </data> </odoo>

It looks like the file you've provided named `assets.xml` does not actually define assets. Instead, it contains a definition for a client action. This is not what you would usually include in a file intended for assets.

I recommend creating a separate XML file to define the assets. Name it something different like `custom_assets.xml` to avoid confusion, and place it in the same directory where your `assets.xml` is currently located (which is usually in the `views` directory).

Here's the content for the `custom_assets.xml` file:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/custom_styles.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Make sure you have the `custom_styles.css` file created as described in the previous message.

Then, you need to reference this new XML file in your module's `__manifest__.py` file. Add `views/custom_assets.xml` to the `data` section of the manifest file, like this:

python

```python
'data': [
    'views/custom_assets.xml',
    # ... other files ...
],
```

After making these changes, update your module in Odoo and you should see the custom styling applied to the "Start" button.

> there is adirocrory already C:\\odoo16\\custom\\tk\_vehicle\_repair\\static\\src\\css\\lib

Okay, if you already have a directory `C:\odoo16\custom\tk_vehicle_repair\static\src\css\lib`, you can place your custom CSS file in there. Let's name the CSS file `custom_styles.css`.

Place the `custom_styles.css` file in the `C:\odoo16\custom\tk_vehicle_repair\static\src\css\lib` directory and put the following CSS code inside it:

css

```css
.start_button {
    background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green background */
    border: none; /* Remove borders */
    color: white; /* White text */
    padding: 15px 32px; /* Some padding */
    text-align: center; /* Centered text */
    text-decoration: none; /* Remove underline */
    display: inline-block; /* Make it inline */
    font-size: 16px; /* Big font size */
    margin: 4px 2px; /* Some margin */
    cursor: pointer; /* Add a pointer on hover */
}
```

Now create a new XML file named `custom_assets.xml` in the `views` directory of your module and place the following content inside:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Now you need to include this new XML file in your module's `__manifest__.py`. Edit the `__manifest__.py` file and add the new XML file to the `data` section like this:

python

```python
'data': [
    'views/custom_assets.xml',
    # ... other files ...
],
```

Finally, update your module through the Odoo interface or by using the command line.

Once you've updated the module, the custom styling should be applied to the "Start" button. If you are not seeing the changes, try clearing your browser's cache and then refresh the page.

> File "C:\\odoo16\\server\\odoo\\tools\\convert.py", line 746, in parse self.\_tag\_root(de) File "C:\\odoo16\\server\\odoo\\tools\\convert.py", line 712, in \_tag\_root )) from e odoo.tools.convert.ParseError: while parsing None:3, somewhere inside <data name="custom\_styles\_assets" inherit\_id="web.assets\_backend"> <xpath expr="." position="inside"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom\_styles.css"/> </xpath> </data>

It seems that there is an issue with the XML file. Instead of using `<data>` tag, use the `<template>` tag as it is required when you are inheriting from 'web.assets\_backend'. Here is the corrected XML content for `custom_assets.xml`:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Make sure that this file is located in the `views` directory of your module and that it is included in the `__manifest__.py` file.

After you make these changes, update your module again.

> what goes in manifest to update the view

To include the new XML file in your module, you need to add it to the `'data'` key in the `__manifest__.py` file. This file, located in the root of your module directory, contains metadata about the module.

Here's an example of what the `__manifest__.py` file might look like, with the new XML file included in the `'data'` key:

python

```python
{
    'name': 'Vehicle Repair',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Custom',
    'summary': 'Vehicle Repair Management',
    'description': """Manage vehicle repairs""",
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'website': 'Your Website',
    'depends': ['base'],
    'data': [
        'security/ir.model.access.csv',
        'views/job_card_views.xml',
        'views/vehicle_details_wizard_views.xml',
        'views/customer_details_wizard_views.xml',
        'views/custom_assets.xml',  # Add this line
    ],
    'demo': [],
    'installable': True,
    'auto_install': False,
}
```

Make sure to replace `'views/custom_assets.xml'` with the actual path to your XML file if it's located elsewhere. After making these changes, update your module through the Odoo interface or by using the command line.

> update this for css file 'assets': { 'web.assets\_backend': \[ 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/xml/template.xml', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/dashboard.css', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/style.scss', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/js/lib/apexcharts.js', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/js/vehicle\_repair\_dashboard.js', \], },

You can include your CSS file by updating the `assets` key in your `__manifest__.py` file. This key should contain dictionaries that map asset bundles to the files you want to include in them.

Here's how you can update the `assets` key to include your new CSS file:

python

```python
{
    'name': 'Vehicle Repair',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Custom',
    'summary': 'Vehicle Repair Management',
    'description': """Manage vehicle repairs""",
    'author': 'Your Name',
    'website': 'Your Website',
    'depends': ['base'],
    'data': [
        'security/ir.model.access.csv',
        'views/job_card_views.xml',
        'views/vehicle_details_wizard_views.xml',
        'views/customer_details_wizard_views.xml',
    ],
    'demo': [],
    'assets': {
        'web.assets_backend': [
            'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/xml/template.xml',
            'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/dashboard.css',
            'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css',  # Add this line
            'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/style.scss',
            'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/js/lib/apexcharts.js',
            'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/js/vehicle_repair_dashboard.js',
        ],
    },
    'installable': True,
    'auto_install': False,
}
```

Note that I added `'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css'` to the `web.assets_backend` list. This tells Odoo to include your new CSS file in the backend assets bundle. After making this change, make sure to update your module so the new file is loaded.

It appears that there is an issue with the XML file that includes your custom CSS file. The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the file, particularly around the `<data>` tag and `inherit_id`.

Please make sure that you have the file correctly structured. The file should be located in your module's views directory. Here is the corrected version of the XML file that includes the custom CSS file:

xml

Make sure that the file is named correctly and is referenced in your module's `__manifest__.py`. For example, if this file is named `assets.xml` and is located in the `views` directory of your module, you should have something like this in your `__manifest__.py`:

python

```python
'data': [
    'views/assets.xml',  # Add this line
    'views/job_card_views.xml',
    'views/vehicle_details_wizard_views.xml',
    'views/customer_details_wizard_views.xml',
    # ... other data files ...
],
```

After making these changes, update your module through the Odoo interface or by using the command line. This will cause Odoo to re-read the XML files and apply the changes.

> is this right type="text/scss" hr

Apologies for the confusion, my mistake. Since you are using a regular CSS file, the `type` attribute should be set to `"text/css"`. Here's the corrected XML snippet:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Please use `type="text/css"` for regular CSS files. Use `type="text/scss"` if you are working with SCSS files.

> here is my file <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <odoo> <template id="assets\_backend" name="custom\_styles\_assets" inherit\_id="web.assets\_backend"> <xpath expr="." position="inside"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom\_styles.css"/> </xpath> </template> </odoo>

Your file looks mostly correct, but you should specify the type attribute as `text/css`. Here's the modified version of your file:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css"/>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Also, make sure that the path to your CSS file is correct and that the file actually exists at that location.

Once you have updated the XML file, you should also ensure that the XML file is referenced in the `__manifest__.py` of your module, like this:

python

```python
{
    # ... other manifest entries ...
    'data': [
        # ... other xml files ...
        'path/to/your/assets.xml',  # <- path to the XML file you just created/updated
    ],
}
```

And, make sure your module is updated in Odoo to apply the changes.

Your manifest file seems to be well structured. However, I see that you have added the `custom_styles.css` file in the 'assets' section. This is an alternative way to include assets and is mostly used for JavaScript and less for CSS. In your case, since you have an XML file to include your CSS, let's stick to using the XML file.

First, remove the line `'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css',` from the 'assets' section in your manifest.

Next, ensure that the XML file that includes your CSS file is listed in the 'data' section. I see you have `'views/custom_assets.xml',` in the 'data' section. Make sure that `custom_assets.xml` is the XML file that includes your CSS file.

Also, make sure the `custom_styles.css` file is present in the directory `tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/`.

After making these changes, update your module again to see if the CSS is applied properly.

> here my custom assets <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <odoo> <template id="assets\_backend" name="custom\_styles\_assets" inherit\_id="web.assets\_backend"> <xpath expr="." position="inside"> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom\_styles.css"/> </xpath> </template> </odoo>

The `custom_assets.xml` file looks correct. Let's summarize the steps and make sure everything is in place:

1.  The `custom_assets.xml` file contains the proper XML to include the `custom_styles.css` file.
2.  The `custom_assets.xml` is listed in the `'data'` section of the manifest file (as `'views/custom_assets.xml',`).
3.  The `custom_styles.css` file is present in the directory `tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/`.
4.  The module is updated after these changes are made.

If all the above steps are confirmed and the CSS is still not being applied, you may want to check a couple of more things:

*   Check your browser's developer tools to see if the CSS file is being loaded. In the developer tools, you can look at the network tab to see if the file is being fetched. You can also look at the elements and see if the styles are being applied or overridden by other styles.
*   Clear your browser cache. Sometimes, browsers cache assets and do not fetch the updated files.

If the issue persists, double-check the CSS rules in the `custom_styles.css` file to make sure that they are correctly targeting the elements you want to style.

> odoo.tools.convert.ParseError: while parsing None:3, somewhere inside <data name="custom\_styles\_assets" inherit\_id="web.assets\_backend"> <xpath expr="." position="inside"> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom\_styles.css"/> </xpath> </data>

The error you're encountering is a parsing error in the XML file. This could be due to some minor mistake in the structure.

Let's make a small adjustment to your `custom_assets.xml`. You need to make sure the `id` attribute for the template is unique. So, instead of `assets_backend` let's name it `assets_custom_styles`.

Here is the updated `custom_assets.xml`:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_custom_styles" name="custom_styles_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">

        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

After making this change, please update the module again and check if it resolves the issue.

The error message indicates that it is unable to find the `web.assets_backend` that you are trying to inherit from.

The possible reason is that the location or name of assets has been changed in Odoo version 16 (which is a version that I don't have knowledge of since my training data is updated until September 2021).

You can search for the appropriate asset bundle in the Odoo source code. This can be done by navigating to the `odoo/addons/web` directory and searching for `assets_backend`. If it's not present there, it might have been renamed or moved to a different location.

Once you find the correct external ID for the assets, you can replace `web.assets_backend` with the correct external ID in the `inherit_id` attribute of your custom XML file.

Also, it's possible that in newer versions of Odoo, there might be a different way to include custom styles or scripts. You might want to check

> my other assest.xml is like this <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <odoo> <data> <record id="action\_vehicle\_repair\_dashboard" model="ir.actions.client"> <field name="name">Statistics</field> <field name="tag">vehicle\_repair\_dashboard</field> </record> </data> </odoo>

The content of your `assets.xml` file that you have shared is different from what I expected. This XML file is defining an action instead of adding CSS or JS assets to the Odoo backend.

For loading CSS assets, you need to find the appropriate asset bundle in Odoo. Since you are working with Odoo 16, which I am not familiar with, the asset bundle may have changed. In previous versions of Odoo, `web.assets_backend` was used to include custom assets in the backend.

As I mentioned previously, you should try searching in the Odoo source code for the correct asset bundle. You can also refer to the official Odoo documentation for version 16 or consult the Odoo community for the most up-to-date practices.

If you find that `web.assets_backend` is indeed the correct asset bundle in version 16, then please double-check your custom XML file for syntax errors. The error message you posted suggests a problem with finding the external ID `web.assets_backend`.

> In odoo16 the js and css are loaded in the module manifest file.

Yes, in Odoo 16, the assets are loaded using the module's manifest file. It's a change compared to previous versions where assets were loaded using an XML file.

So, you should add your CSS file to the `assets` section in your module's manifest file. From what you posted before, it should be something like this:

python

```python
'assets': {
    'web.assets_backend': [
        # other files...
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css',
        # other files...
    ],
},
```

Make sure that your `custom_styles.css` is actually located in the directory specified (`tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/`).

After updating the manifest file, you need to restart the Odoo server and update your module for the changes to take effect.

Also, since you are using the manifest file to include assets, you do not need the custom XML file for this purpose. You can remove the XML file you were trying to use to include the CSS, as it's not needed in Odoo 16.

> File "C:\\odoo16\\server\\odoo\\tools\\convert.py", line 712, in \_tag\_root )) from e odoo.tools.convert.ParseError: while parsing None:3, somewhere inside <data name="Custom Styles Assets" inherit\_id="web.assets\_backend"> <xpath expr="." position="inside"> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom\_styles.css"/> </xpath> </data>

As I mentioned earlier, in Odoo 16, you should not use XML to include CSS or JS files as assets. This should be done in the module's manifest file instead.

You should remove the XML file that you are trying to use to include the CSS file and make sure that your CSS file is properly included in the manifest file of the module under the `assets` key.

Here is how the manifest file should look like (notice the inclusion of `custom_styles.css`):

python

```python
{
    'name': "Your Module Name",
    'version': "1.0",
    'depends': ['base'],
    'data': [
        # include your XML, views, etc here...
    ],
    'assets': {
        'web.assets_backend': [
            # include your JS files...
            'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css',
        ],
    },
    'installable': True,
    'application': True,
}
```

After you update the manifest file, please make sure to restart your Odoo server and update your module so that the changes take effect.

Also, ensure that the path to your CSS file is correct and the file is present in the specified directory.

> so i dont need the custom \_assets.xml

Exactly, you don't need the `custom_assets.xml` file for adding CSS in Odoo 16. The assets should be specified directly in the module's manifest file under the `assets` key. This is a change from previous versions of Odoo, where you would use XML to include assets. In Odoo 16, this is streamlined and made simpler by just including them in the manifest file.

Make sure to remove the reference to `custom_assets.xml` from your manifest's `'data': []` section as well, so Odoo doesn't try to load it. After doing these changes, restart your Odoo server and update the module.

> it instaklled with nor wrros but css nt applied

If the module is installed without errors, but the CSS is not being applied, let's go through a few troubleshooting steps:

1.  **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes, the browser caches the CSS. Clear your browser cache and refresh the page to see if the new CSS is applied.
    
2.  **Check CSS Path**: Ensure that the path to your CSS file in the manifest file is correct. Confirm that the file actually exists in that location.
    
3.  **Check CSS Rules**: Ensure that the CSS file contains valid CSS rules and that they are properly targeting the elements you wish to style.
    
4.  **Check Developer Tools**: Open your browser's developer tools and check the Network tab to see if the CSS file is being loaded. Also, check the Console for any errors.
    
5.  **Restart Server**: Make sure you've restarted the Odoo server after making changes to the manifest file.
    
6.  **Update Module**: Ensure that the module has been updated after adding the CSS. You can do this through the Odoo interface by going to the Apps menu, removing the "Apps" filter, searching for your module, and clicking "Update".
    
7.  **Inspect Element**: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element you're trying to style. Check if your styles are being overridden by another CSS rule. If so, you might need to make your selector more specific, or use `!important` to override other styles.
    

Please go through these steps and let me know if you're still facing issues.

> assets': { 'web.assets\_backend': \[ 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/xml/template.xml', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/dashboard.css', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/style.scss', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/js/lib/apexcharts.js', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom\_styles.css', 'tk\_vehicle\_repair/static/src/js/vehicle\_repair\_dashboard.js', \],

The `assets` section of your manifest file looks fine as long as the file paths are correct and the files exist at those locations.

However, since you're loading CSS into the backend, you should consider specifying them under `'web.assets_backend_css'` in Odoo 16.

Try structuring your manifest file like this:

python

```python
'assets': {
    'web.assets_backend': [
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/xml/template.xml',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/js/lib/apexcharts.js',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/js/vehicle_repair_dashboard.js',
    ],
    'web.assets_backend_css': [
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/dashboard.css',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/style.scss',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css',
    ],
},
```

This is a new change in Odoo 16 where it allows specifying JavaScript and CSS separately for backend assets.

After you make these changes, make sure to:

1.  Save the manifest file.
2.  Restart the Odoo server.
3.  Update the module in the Odoo backend.
4.  Clear your browser cache and refresh the page.

Let me know if this resolves the issue.

> path to css C:\\odoo16\\custom\\tk\_vehicle\_repair\\static\\src\\css\\lib\\custom\_styles.css

If the path to your CSS file is `C:\odoo16\custom\tk_vehicle_repair\static\src\css\lib\custom_styles.css`, you should make sure that the module is placed in a directory that Odoo recognizes. Odoo usually looks for modules in the "addons" directory, so you should make sure that the module's directory (`tk_vehicle_repair`) is in a directory that Odoo is looking at.

Once you have ensured that your module is in the correct directory, update your manifest file as mentioned in my previous response:

python

```python
'assets': {
    'web.assets_backend': [
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/xml/template.xml',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/js/lib/apexcharts.js',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/js/vehicle_repair_dashboard.js',
    ],
    'web.assets_backend_css': [
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/dashboard.css',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/style.scss',
        'tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css',
    ],
},
```

And then:

1.  Restart the Odoo server.
2.  Update the module in the Odoo backend.
3.  Clear your browser cache and refresh the page.

Also, please check if the path `tk_vehicle_repair/static/src/css/lib/custom_styles.css` in the manifest is correct relative to the location of the module. The paths in the manifest should be relative to the module's root directory (which contains the manifest file).

> Can I add border width .btn-secondary { margin: 0.25rem; color: #fff !important; background-color: hsl(112, 36%, 46%) !important; border-color: #74788d !important; }

Yes, you can add a `border-width` property to the `.btn-secondary` class in your CSS. The `border-width` property is used to set the width of the borders of an element. You can specify the width in different units such as pixels (`px`), ems (`em`), or points (`pt`). Here's an example:

css

```css
.btn-secondary {
    margin: 0.25rem;
    color: #fff !important;
    background-color: hsl(112, 36%, 46%) !important;
    border-color: #74788d !important;
    border-width: 2px; /* This sets the border width */
}
```

In this example, the border-width is set to `2px`. You can adjust this value according to your requirements.

> what does important do

The `!important` rule in CSS is used to give a style declaration the highest priority. When CSS styles are conflicting, the `!important` rule forces the browser to apply the particular style, regardless of the specificity of other selectors.

Normally, the precedence of CSS rules is determined based on specificity (how specific a selector is) and source order (later rules overriding earlier ones). However, if a style declaration includes the `!important` rule, it overrides any other declarations.

Here is an example:

css

```css
p {
    color: blue;
}

p {
    color: red !important;
}
```

In this example, the text inside the `<p>` element will be red, because the `!important` rule gives the second declaration higher priority.

Using `!important` should be done with caution as it can make the CSS harder to read and maintain, and it's often considered a bad practice unless it's absolutely necessary. It's usually recommended to use more specific selectors or refactor the CSS to avoid the need for using `!important`.

> do you remeber muy vechile module. When I click Start it opens a wizard of vechile

As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to remember past conversations or details about your projects. However, if you mentioned earlier in this conversation that clicking "Start" opens a wizard in your vehicle module, that would be part of the module's functionality designed using Odoo's framework. If you need assistance with something specific related to that, please let me know, and I'll do my best to help.

> tk\_vehicle\_repair

As you mentioned `tk_vehicle_repair`, it seems to be the name of your custom Odoo module for vehicle repair management. If clicking "Start" opens a wizard, this behavior would be programmed in the module.

In Odoo, a wizard is generally used to take user input or display data temporarily. It can be triggered by a button click or any other action. This behavior is controlled by defining actions in the module's XML files and writing corresponding Python methods to handle the logic.

If you need assistance with something specific related to this module or need help with a particular feature or issue, please provide more details so I can help you more effectively.

> here is my buttons <header> <field name="task" widget="statusbar"/> <field name="is\_started" invisible="1"/> <button name="%(action\_vehicle\_technician)d" string="Assign To Technician" type="action" class="btn-primary" attrs="{'invisible': \[('technician\_id', '!=', False)\]}"/> <button string="Start Repair " type="object" name="action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard" class="btn-secondary" attrs="{'invisible': \[('is\_started', '=', True)\]}"/> <button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': \[('is\_started', '=', False)\]}"/> <button string="Customer" type="object" name="action\_open\_customer\_details\_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': \[('is\_started', '=', False)\]}"/>

From the code you posted, it appears that you have defined several buttons in the header of a form view in your `tk_vehicle_repair` Odoo module.

Let's break down each button:

1.  The first button named `Assign To Technician` is triggering a server action with the ID `action_vehicle_technician`. This button is visible only if the `technician_id` field is not set (`False`).
    
2.  The second button with the label `Start Repair` calls the method `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` on the server-side. This button will be visible only if the field `is_started` is `False`.
    
3.  The third button labeled `Vehicle` also calls the same method `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` on the server-side. This button will be visible only if the field `is_started` is `True`.
    
4.  The fourth button labeled `Customer` calls the method `action_open_customer_details_wizard` on the server-side. This button is visible only if the field `is_started` is `False`.
    

The methods `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` and `action_open_customer_details_wizard` are likely defined in a Python file and handle the logic of what should happen when these buttons are clicked, including opening wizards.

If you are looking to understand or modify the behavior of any of these buttons, you should find the corresponding Python methods in your module's Python files and check the logic implemented in them. Additionally, you should check the XML file where the action with the ID `action_vehicle_technician` is defined.

In your `customer_details_wizard.py` file, you have defined two wizard classes:

1.  `CustomerDetailsWizard`: This class is a transient model (wizard) that has fields for `customer_id`, `phone`, and `email`. It has one method, `button_save_details`, which is responsible for saving the details from the wizard to the corresponding `job.card` record when the save button is clicked in the wizard.
    
2.  `VehicleDetailsWizard`: This class is another transient model that has fields for vehicle details such as `avatar`, `vehicle_brand_id`, `vehicle_model_id`, `reg_no`, `chassis_no`, `vin_no`, `engine_no`, and `kms_reading`. There are two methods in this class:
    
    *   `default_get`: This

> here is my view for the wizard <odoo> <data> <record id="vehicle\_details\_wizard\_form\_view" model="ir.ui.view"> <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field> <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field> <field name="arch" type="xml"> <form> <sheet> <div class="oe\_title"> <!-- Add the image --> <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe\_avatar" options="{'size': \[90, 90\]}" nolabel="1"/> <!-- Vehicle Details Group --> <group> <field name="vehicle\_brand\_id"/> <field name="vehicle\_model\_id"/> <field name="reg\_no"/> <field name="chassis\_no"/> <field name="vin\_no"/> <field name="engine\_no"/> <field name="kms\_reading"/> </group> </div> </sheet> <footer> <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button\_save\_details"/> <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/> </footer> </form> </field> </record> </data> </odoo>

The view XML file you have posted defines the form view for the `VehicleDetailsWizard` transient model. Here's a brief explanation of what this XML code does:

1.  `<record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">` - This line creates a new record in the `ir.ui.view` model, which represents the view.
    
2.  `<field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>` - This sets the internal name for this view.
    
3.  `<field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>` - Specifies that this view is for the `vehicle.details.wizard` model.
    
4.  `<field name="arch" type="xml">` - Begins the definition of the view architecture in XML.
    
5.  Inside the `<form>` tag:
    
    *   A `<sheet>` tag is used to group fields together.
    *   Inside the `<sheet>`, there is a `<div>` with class `oe_title` that contains the image field `avatar` and other vehicle details fields such as `vehicle_brand_id`, `vehicle_model_id`, `reg_no`, `chassis_no`, `vin_no`, `engine_no`, and `kms_reading` grouped together in a `<group>` tag.
    *   The `avatar` field uses the `image` widget.
6.  The `<footer>` section contains two buttons:
    
    *   The "Save" button with class `btn-primary` is connected to the `button_save_details` method defined in the \`

> I would like the Image on the first row and underneat have a group or something. At the moment we have Name Model Registration Number Chassis Number Vin Number Engine NUmber KMS Reading I want w colums like Name Model Registraion Number CHassis Number

You can achieve this layout by using the `col` attribute in the `<group>` tag to specify the number of columns you want. The `col` attribute can be used to organize fields into columns. Below is the modified version of your XML view file:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <sheet>
                        <!-- Image on the first row -->
                        <div class="oe_title">
                            <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Group with 2 columns -->
                        <group col="2">
                            <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                            <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                            <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                            <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                            <field name="vin_no"/>
                            <field name="engine_no"/>
                            <field name="kms_reading"/>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

In this modified version:

*   The image stays on its own row.
*   The details fields are grouped into 2 columns with the `col="2"` attribute.

> that does not work. I get no errors just does not have 2 coloums

I apologize for the confusion. Let me correct the layout. You should use nested `<group>` tags to organize the fields into columns. Here is an updated version:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <sheet>
                        <div class="oe_title">
                            <!-- Image on the first row -->
                            <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Group to organize into rows -->
                        <group>
                            <!-- Nested group for first row with 2 columns -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                                <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                            </group>
                            
                            <!-- Nested group for second row with 2 columns -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                                <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                            </group>
                            
                            <!-- Other fields -->
                            <field name="vin_no"/>
                            <field name="engine_no"/>
                            <field name="kms_reading"/>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This structure should create a layout with the image on the first row and then the fields arranged in two columns underneath it.

> need all the feilds <field name="vehicle\_brand\_id"/> <field name="vehicle\_model\_id"/> <field name="reg\_no"/> <field name="chassis\_no"/> <field name="vin\_no"/> <field name="engine\_no"/> <field name="kms\_reading"/>

Certainly, you can organize all the fields in two columns under the image by using nested groups. Below is the updated XML:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <sheet>
                        <div class="oe_title">
                            <!-- Image on the first row -->
                            <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Group to organize into rows -->
                        <group>
                            <!-- Nested group for first row with 2 columns -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                                <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                            </group>
                            
                            <!-- Nested group for second row with 2 columns -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                                <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                            </group>
                            
                            <!-- Nested group for third row with 2 columns -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="vin_no" string="VIN Number"/>
                                <field name="engine_no" string="Engine Number"/>
                            </group>

                            <!-- Additional fields -->
                            <field name="kms_reading"/>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This structure arranges the fields under the image in two columns with `Name` and `Model` in the first row, `Registration Number` and `Chassis Number` in the second row, `VIN Number` and `Engine Number` in the third row, and `KMS Reading` below them.

> the image is not first should it be in th ehease of the wizad we have 3 colouns now Name Registraion number and Image are allon first coloums in that order

To have the image at the top and fields in two columns below, we can use the `<group>` element and separate the image using a `<div>` element. Below is the updated XML:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <sheet>
                        <!-- Image on the top -->
                        <div class="oe_title" style="text-align:center;">
                            <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Group to organize fields into 2 columns -->
                        <group col="2">
                            <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                            <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                            <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                            <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                            <field name="vin_no" string="VIN Number"/>
                            <field name="engine_no" string="Engine Number"/>
                            <field name="kms_reading"/>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This arrangement places the image at the top center and arranges the fields below it in two columns. The `col` attribute in the `<group>` tag specifies the number of columns for the fields within the group.

> now everything gome back single lines. Where is col 1?

It's possible that the group is automatically rendering in a single column due to the layout constraints or styling. However, you can try wrapping the fields inside another `<group>` to make sure that the internal fields are arranged in two columns:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <sheet>
                        <!-- Image on the top -->
                        <div class="oe_title" style="text-align:center;">
                            <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Group to organize fields -->
                        <group>
                            <!-- Nested group to force 2 columns -->
                            <group col="2">
                                <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                                <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                                <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                                <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                                <field name="vin_no" string="VIN Number"/>
                                <field name="engine_no" string="Engine Number"/>
                                <field name="kms_reading"/>
                            </group>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

Here, I have wrapped the fields in an additional `<group>` tag inside the outer `<group>` to specify the two-column layout.

> i want these on the left <field name="vehicle\_brand\_id" string="Name"/> <field name="vehicle\_model\_id" string="Model"/> <field name="reg\_no" string="Registration Number"/> these on the right <field name="chassis\_no" string="Chassis Number"/> <field name="vin\_no" string="VIN Number"/> <field name="engine\_no" string="Engine Number"/> <field name="kms\_reading string = KNS Reading"/> image at top

Got it. You can do this by wrapping the left fields in one `<group>` and the right fields in another `<group>`, both inside an outer `<group>`. Here's how the XML should look:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">

</odoo>
```

This should layout the form with the image at the top and the fields in two columns, left and right, below the image.

> Image is to the righ tmaking eveyting else smaller if image was at the top header it would be ok

In order to move the image to the top of the form, you can create a structure where the image is placed above the group columns. You can achieve this by nesting the image and the group columns inside another group, which will stack the elements vertically. Here's an example of how the XML should look:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <sheet>
                        <!-- Outer group to stack elements vertically -->
                        <group>
                            <!-- Image on the top -->
                            <div class="oe_title" style="text-align:center;">
                                <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                            </div>

                            <!-- Group for two columns -->
                            <group>
                                <!-- Left column -->
                                <group>
                                    <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                                    <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                                    <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                                </group>
                                <!-- Right column -->
                                <group>
                                    <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                                    <field name="vin_no" string="VIN Number"/>
                                    <field name="engine_no" string="Engine Number"/>
                                    <field name="kms_reading" string="KMS Reading"/>
                                </group>
                            </group>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This structure should place the image at the top, with the fields in two columns below it.

> now iameg has moved to the left. Can we move image to header of wizaard

You can achieve this by placing the image field outside of the `sheet` element and using custom styling to align it in the header section.

Here is an example:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <!-- Image at the top -->
                    <div class="header_image" style="text-align:center; padding: 10px;">
                        <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [90, 90]}" nolabel="1"/>
                    </div>
                    <sheet>
                        <!-- Group for two columns -->
                        <group>
                            <!-- Left column -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                                <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                                <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                            </group>
                            <!-- Right column -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                                <field name="vin_no" string="VIN Number"/>
                                <field name="engine_no" string="Engine Number"/>
                                <field name="kms_reading" string="KMS Reading"/>
                            </group>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

This will place the image outside of the sheet section and by using custom inline styles, it is centered. This approach is not ideal, since inline styles are generally not recommended, but it should work for your case. Ideally, you should place the custom styles in an external CSS file and apply classes as needed.

> this is nearly correct. I an only see part of the imafe box

If the image is partially cut off or not displaying correctly, it may be due to the size of the container or the image itself. You could try adjusting the size of the image through the options or adjust the container's styling to ensure it's displayed correctly.

Also, to make sure there is enough space for the image, you can adjust the padding or margin around the image. Here's the modified XML:

xml

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
            <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <form>
                    <!-- Image at the top -->
                    <div class="header_image" style="text-align:center; padding: 20px;">
                        <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [120, 120]}" nolabel="1"/>
                    </div>
                    <sheet>
                        <!-- Group for two columns -->
                        <group>
                            <!-- Left column -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="vehicle_brand_id" string="Name"/>
                                <field name="vehicle_model_id" string="Model"/>
                                <field name="reg_no" string="Registration Number"/>
                            </group>
                            <!-- Right column -->
                            <group>
                                <field name="chassis_no" string="Chassis Number"/>
                                <field name="vin_no" string="VIN Number"/>
                                <field name="engine_no" string="Engine Number"/>
                                <field name="kms_reading" string="KMS Reading"/>
                            </group>
                        </group>
                    </sheet>
                    <footer>
                        <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                        <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
                    </footer>
                </form>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>

```

I increased the padding around the image and adjusted the size options of the image itself. You can adjust these values further as needed to achieve the desired appearance. Also, ensure that the image you are uploading is not too large in dimensions which could also cause display issues.

> this works but it leace a big white spce <div class="header\_image" style="text-align:center; padding: 120px;">

The large white space is likely due to the large padding value of 120px. You can reduce the padding to decrease the white space around the image. Try using a smaller padding value, like 20px, to see if it reduces the white space to your liking:

xml

```xml
<div class="header_image" style="text-align:center; padding: 20px;">
```

If you need even less space, you can try reducing the padding further:

xml

```xml
<div class="header_image" style="text-align:center; padding: 10px;">
```

Adjust the padding value until you achieve the desired spacing around the image.

> when 1ts 2owe cant see the image. there is white space at the top of the image

If you need to keep the vertical space for the image but want to reduce the white space at the top, you could try modifying the padding to only affect the bottom. This can be done by specifying padding values for the top, right, bottom, and left specifically.

Here is an example where padding-top is set to a smaller value (e.g., 10px) and padding-bottom is set to a larger value (e.g., 100px) to keep space for the image:

xml

```xml
<div class="header_image" style="text-align:center; padding: 10px 0px 100px 0px;">
```

This style sets the top padding to 10px, right padding to 0, bottom padding to 100px, and left padding to 0.

Adjust the values as necessary to achieve the desired effect.

> The image in the wizard was saving to the job\_card.py here is my function def action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard(self): view\_id = self.env.ref('tk\_vehicle\_repair.vehicle\_details\_wizard\_form\_view').id return { 'name': 'Vehicle Details', 'type': 'ir.actions.act\_window', 'res\_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard', 'view\_mode': 'form', 'view\_id': view\_id, 'target': 'new', 'context': { 'default\_vehicle\_brand\_id': self.vehicle\_brand\_id.id, 'default\_vehicle\_model\_id': self.vehicle\_model\_id.id, 'default\_reg\_no': self.reg\_no, 'default\_chassis\_no': self.chassis\_no, 'default\_vin\_no': self.vin\_no, 'default\_engine\_no': self.engine\_no, 'default\_kms\_reading': self.kms\_reading, 'active\_id': self.id },

The function `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` opens a wizard with the form view `vehicle_details_wizard_form_view` for the model `vehicle.details.wizard`. The form will show fields pre-filled with data from the current record (`self`) and will be opened in a new window (`'target': 'new'`).

The `'context'` key is used to pass values that should be pre-filled in the wizard. The fields specified with `default_` prefixes in the context are intended to pre-fill the wizard fields with the corresponding values from the current record.

For example:

*   `'default_vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id` means that the `vehicle_brand_id` field in the wizard will be pre-filled with the vehicle brand from the current record.
*   `'default_reg_no': self.reg_no` means that the `reg_no` field in the wizard will be pre-filled with the registration number from the current record.

The `'active_id': self.id` in the context is intended to pass the ID of the current record (`job_card`) to the wizard. This is often used in wizards to know which record to update after making changes in the wizard.

When the wizard's Save button is clicked, it usually calls a method (in this case probably `button_save_details`) that takes the values entered in the wizard, and writes them back to the original record. This method would use the `active_id` passed in the context to know which record needs to be updated.

> why isnt it avinf the image everything else saves

From the code you have provided for the `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` method, it looks like you are not passing the image field (`avatar`) in the context to be pre-filled in the wizard.

Also, in the `button_save_details` method within the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class, you should ensure that the image field (`avatar`) is being updated.

Please make sure that:

1.  You pass the image in the context when opening the wizard.
2.  You include the image field in the `write` method within the wizard's save method.

Here's how you can modify the `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` method to pass the image in the context:

python

```python
def action_open_vehicle_details_wizard(self):
    view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.vehicle_details_wizard_form_view').id
    return {
        'name': 'Vehicle Details',
        'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
        'res_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard',
        'view_mode': 'form',
        'view_id': view_id,
        'target': 'new',
        'context': {
            'default_avatar': self.avatar,  # Include this line to pass the image
            'default_vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'default_vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'default_reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'default_chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'default_vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'default_engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'default_kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'active_id': self.id
        },
    }
```

And make sure the `button_save_details` method within the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class includes the image field in the `write` method:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'avatar': self.avatar,  # Make sure this line is present to update the image
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })
```

This should help in saving the image along with the other fields.

> here is my class class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel): \_name = 'vehicle.details.wizard' \_description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard' avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image") vehicle\_brand\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Name") vehicle\_model\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model", domain="\[('vehicle\_brand\_id', '=', vehicle\_brand\_id)\]") reg\_no = fields.Char(string="Registration Number") chassis\_no = fields.Char(string="Chassis Number") vin\_no = fields.Char(string="VIN Number") engine\_no = fields.Char(string="Engine Number") kms\_reading = fields.Integer(string="KMS Reading") def default\_get(self, fields\_list): # Get the default values from the context defaults = super(VehicleDetailsWizard, self).default\_get(fields\_list) defaults\['vehicle\_brand\_id'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_vehicle\_brand\_id') defaults\['vehicle\_model\_id'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_vehicle\_model\_id') defaults\['reg\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_reg\_no') defaults\['chassis\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_chassis\_no') defaults\['vin\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_vin\_no') defaults\['engine\_no'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_engine\_no') defaults\['kms\_reading'\] = self.env.context.get('default\_kms\_reading') return defaults def button\_save\_details(self): active\_id = self.env.context.get('active\_id') if active\_id: job\_card = self.env\['job.card'\].browse(active\_id) # Update the job card with details from the wizard job\_card.write({ 'avatar': self.avatar, 'vehicle\_brand\_id': self.vehicle\_brand\_id.id, 'vehicle\_model\_id': self.vehicle\_model\_id.id, 'reg\_no': self.reg\_no, 'chassis\_no': self.chassis\_no, 'vin\_no': self.vin\_no, 'engine\_no': self.engine\_no, 'kms\_reading': self.kms\_reading, 'is\_started': True # setting is\_started to True })

You need to add the image (`avatar`) to the `default_get` method in the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class so that it retrieves the image from the context when the wizard is opened.

Here's the modified `default_get` method in the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class with the image added:

python

```python
def default_get(self, fields_list):
    # Get the default values from the context
    defaults = super(VehicleDetailsWizard, self).default_get(fields_list)
    
    defaults['avatar'] = self.env.context.get('default_avatar') # Include this line to get the image
    defaults['vehicle_brand_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_brand_id')
    defaults['vehicle_model_id'] = self.env.context.get('default_vehicle_model_id')
    defaults['reg_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_reg_no')
    defaults['chassis_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_chassis_no')
    defaults['vin_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_vin_no')
    defaults['engine_no'] = self.env.context.get('default_engine_no')
    defaults['kms_reading'] = self.env.context.get('default_kms_reading')
    return defaults
```

Make sure that in the `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` method, you're passing the image as part of the context (as I showed in the previous response). This way, the image is passed to the wizard and retrieved by the `default_get` method.

> when I change teh image in the wizard it does ot save it

It's possible that the avatar field in the wizard is not being saved because the data is not being passed correctly from the wizard back to the `job.card` model.

In the `button_save_details` method of the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class, you are already updating the `job.card` model with the details from the wizard using `job_card.write()`.

Please make sure that the `avatar` field in the `job.card` model has the same type as in the wizard. It should be a `Binary` field as well.

Here is how you are currently saving the data from the wizard to the `job.card`:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'avatar': self.avatar,
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })
```

This should work correctly if the `avatar` field is a Binary field in both the `job.card` model and the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class. Please double-check the field types in both places. If the types are different, it may cause the saving to fail.

Additionally, make sure that the `job.card` model has proper access rights to the fields, especially if you're dealing with binary data such as images.

> class JobCard(models.Model): """Vehicle Job Card""" \_name = 'job.card' \_description = \_\_doc\_\_ \_inherit = \['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin'\] \_rec\_name = 'job\_card\_number' avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image")

The field type for `avatar` in `JobCard` model is `Binary`, which is correct.

Let's debug this step by step:

1.  First, let's ensure that the image is actually being read into the wizard. To confirm that, try printing the avatar data after selecting the image in the wizard. In the `button_save_details` method, just before writing to the `job.card`, add this line:
    
    python
    
    ```python
    print("Avatar Data:", self.avatar)
    ```
    
    This will print the image data in the terminal where Odoo is running. You should see some data printed there. If it's empty, then the image is not being read into the wizard.
    
2.  If the avatar data is present in the wizard, the next thing to check is whether the active\_id is being correctly fetched. You can add another print statement to check this:
    
    python
    
    ```python
    print("Active ID:", active_id)
    ```
    
3.  If both the avatar data and the active\_id are present, then the issue might be with the write permissions or something else.
    

Please run these debugging steps and let me know what you find. Additionally, check the Odoo server logs for any warnings or error messages that might give more information about what is happening.

> I will try that next is this right class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel): \_name = 'vehicle.details.wizard' \_description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard' avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image") vehicle\_brand\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.brand', string="Name") vehicle\_model\_id = fields.Many2one('vehicle.model', string="Model", domain="\[('vehicle\_brand\_id', '=', vehicle\_brand\_id)\]") reg\_no = fields.Char(string="Registration Number") chassis\_no = fields.Char(string="Chassis Number") vin\_no = fields.Char(string="VIN Number") engine\_no = fields.Char(string="Engine Number") kms\_reading = fields.Integer(string="KMS Reading")

Yes, the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class seems fine. The `avatar` field is of type `Binary`, which is suitable for storing images.

Now, follow the debugging steps I mentioned in my previous response by modifying the `button_save_details` method inside the `VehicleDetailsWizard` class:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    print("Active ID:", active_id)  # Add this line for debugging
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        print("Avatar Data:", self.avatar)  # Add this line for debugging
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'avatar': self.avatar,
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })
```

After you have made these modifications, restart your Odoo server, and then try saving the image through the wizard again. Check the terminal or command prompt where the Odoo server is running to see the output of the print statements.

This will help in understanding if the image data is being captured and if the active\_id is being fetched correctly. Let me know the output, and we can then figure out the next steps.

> it is saving you just canot see ituntil you go back in. von the wizard when I click save the image does not update when i save teh job card it updtes

I see. This behavior occurs because the transient model's data (in this case, the image) does not automatically update the fields on the main form. When you save the wizard, it writes the data to the database, but the main form still holds the old data in the user interface until it is reloaded.

To make the main form refresh immediately after saving the wizard, you need to return an action from the `button_save_details` method of the wizard that refreshes the view of the main form. This will make the changes made through the wizard immediately visible on the main form.

You can do this by returning an action dictionary that tells the main form to reload. Modify the `button_save_details` method like this:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'avatar': self.avatar,
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })

    # Close the wizard and reload the main form
    return {
        'type': 'ir.actions.client',
        'tag': 'reload',
    }
```

This action dictionary tells Odoo to execute a client action with the tag 'reload', which refreshes the current view and shows the changes made through the wizard.

> where did you make the change

I made changes to the `button_save_details` method in the VehicleDetailsWizard class. Specifically, after the `job_card.write()` method where you save the data from the wizard to the database, I returned an action dictionary to reload the main form.

Here's the modified `button_save_details` method again for clarity:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'avatar': self.avatar,
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })

    # Close the wizard and reload the main form
    return {
        'type': 'ir.actions.client',
        'tag': 'reload',
    }
```

This additional return statement tells Odoo to execute a client-side action, which in this case is to reload the current view. This should make the changes made in the wizard immediately visible on the main form after you save the wizard.

> can y comment your changes

Certainly! I added comments to explain the changes:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'avatar': self.avatar,
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })

    # The following lines are the change:
    # This return statement closes the wizard and reloads the current view.
    # It helps in reflecting the changes made in the wizard to the main form immediately.
    return {
        'type': 'ir.actions.client',
        'tag': 'reload',
    }
```

The comments are added to explain what the `return` statement is doing. It is returning a dictionary with a special action that tells the Odoo client to reload the current view, reflecting any changes that were made in the wizard immediately in the main form.

> no i dont like that it makes it slower. It will be ok the other way once job card is saved it updates

I understand. In that case, you can revert the changes and use the original method. It's a design choice. If the users are fine with the fact that the image will get updated once the job card is saved, then it shouldn't be an issue. Here's the original method without the additional return statement:

python

```python
def button_save_details(self):
    active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
    if active_id:
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
        # Update the job card with details from the wizard
        job_card.write({
            'avatar': self.avatar,
            'vehicle_brand_id': self.vehicle_brand_id.id,
            'vehicle_model_id': self.vehicle_model_id.id,
            'reg_no': self.reg_no,
            'chassis_no': self.chassis_no,
            'vin_no': self.vin_no,
            'engine_no': self.engine_no,
            'kms_reading': self.kms_reading,
            'is_started': True  # setting is_started to True
        })
```

This will just save the data in the wizard to the job card without refreshing the view. The changes will be visible once the job card is saved and reopened.

> do wizards not work on mobile devies

Wizards in Odoo should work on mobile devices, but there are a few things to consider for optimal user experience:

1.  **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the wizards are designed responsively so that they adjust and render properly on smaller screens. Sometimes, the layout that looks good on a desktop might not be user-friendly on a mobile device.
    
2.  **Performance**: Mobile devices generally have less processing power compared to desktop computers, so it's important to optimize for performance especially if your wizard is processing a large amount of data.
    
3.  **Internet Connectivity**: Mobile devices might have slower or less stable internet connections, so it's important to consider how your wizard behaves in low-bandwidth situations.
    
4.  **Browser Compatibility**: Make sure that the mobile browser being used is compatible with the version of Odoo you are using. Some browsers might not support certain features.
    
5.  **Odoo Version**: Different versions of Odoo have varying levels of mobile optimization. Newer versions tend to have better mobile support.
    
6.  **Odoo Mobile App**: Odoo also has a mobile app which is designed to work well on mobile devices. Sometimes, using the app can offer a better experience compared to using a mobile browser.
    

If you are experiencing issues with wizards on mobile devices, it is recommended to check these factors and optimize accordingly.

> what does this mean It allows up to 100 API requests per day with a rate-limit of 1 requests/second.

The statement "It allows up to 100 API requests per day with a rate-limit of 1 request/second" is setting two different limitations on how an API (Application Programming Interface) can be accessed:

1.  **Daily Limit (100 API requests per day)**: This means that in a single day, you can make a maximum of 100 requests to the API. Once you have made 100 requests on a given day, you will not be able to make any more requests until the next day.
    
2.  **Rate Limit (1 request per second)**: This is a limit on how frequently you can make requests to the API. With a rate limit of 1 request per second, you can make one request every second but no more. If you try to make a second request within the same second, it will be rejected or you might have to wait.
    

These limits are often put in place to prevent abuse or overuse of the API, ensuring that it remains stable and available to all users. It's important to design your application to respect these limits to avoid being temporarily blocked or facing other issues when interacting with the API.

> from the code above explain the module to me

The code you have posted is part of an Odoo module named `tk_vehicle_repair`. Odoo is an open-source ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software that is highly modular. You can extend its functionality by creating custom modules.

The `tk_vehicle_repair` module appears to be a custom module developed for managing vehicle repairs. Based on the snippets of code you've shown, here's a summary of the functionality of this module:

1.  **Job Cards**: This module introduces the concept of a 'Job Card' which seems to be a record representing a repair job for a vehicle. The `JobCard` model contains information such as the vehicle's brand, model, registration number, chassis number, VIN number, engine number, KMS reading, and an image (avatar).
    
2.  **Wizards**: Wizards are often used in Odoo to collect extra information or to guide the user through a multi-step process. In this module, there are two wizards named `VehicleDetailsWizard` and `CustomerDetailsWizard`.
    
    *   `VehicleDetailsWizard`: This wizard is used to collect and edit vehicle-related information. It seems that when a job card is being processed, this wizard can be used to enter/update details about the vehicle that is being repaired.
        
    *   `CustomerDetailsWizard`: Although the code for `CustomerDetailsWizard` is not fully shown, based on its name it likely deals with customer-related information.
        
3.  **View Definitions**: Alongside the Python classes, you have shown an XML file which defines the user interface of the `VehicleDetailsWizard`. This view defines how the form looks, the fields it has, and their arrangement.
    
4.  **Buttons and Actions**: The module also defines buttons that can be clicked on to trigger certain actions. For example, one of the buttons, when clicked, opens the `VehicleDetailsWizard`. Another button starts the repair job and changes the status of the Job Card.
    
5.  **Constraints**: There are constraints defined such as allowing the `Assign To Technician` button to be visible only if the technician is not assigned. Similarly, certain buttons are visible based on the status of the job card.
    
6.  **Saving Details**: The wizards have functions like `button_save_details` which are used to save the details from the wizard back to the main job card record.
    

In summary, the `tk_vehicle_repair` module seems to provide a system to manage vehicle repair jobs within Odoo, including capturing vehicle and customer information and monitoring the progress/status of repair jobs.

> we created a button Called Start when we click Start we get vehilel details when we click customer we get customer <header> <field name="task" widget="statusbar"/> <field name="is\_started" invisible="1"/> <button name="%(action\_vehicle\_technician)d" string="Assign To Technician" type="action" class="btn-primary" attrs="{'invisible': \[('technician\_id', '!=', False)\]}"/> <button string="Start Repair" type="object" name="action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard" class="btn-secondary" attrs="{'invisible': \[('is\_started', '=', True)\]}"/> <button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action\_open\_vehicle\_details\_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': \[('is\_started', '=', False)\]}"/> <button string="Customer" type="object" name="action\_open\_customer\_details\_wizard" attrs="{'invisible': \[('is\_started', '=', False)\]}"/>

The code snippet you provided is part of the XML view definition for the 'Job Card' form view in the Odoo `tk_vehicle_repair` module. This snippet defines the header section of the form, and it includes various buttons that trigger different actions:

1.  **Assign To Technician**: This button, when clicked, executes the action defined in `action_vehicle_technician`. This likely allows the user to assign a technician to the repair job. The button is visible only if the technician has not been assigned (as defined by the condition `('technician_id', '!=', False)`).
    
2.  **Start Repair**: When this button is clicked, it calls the method `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard` from the Python code. This method probably opens the `VehicleDetailsWizard` for the user to enter or update vehicle details. This button is only visible if the `is_started` field is `False`, which indicates that the repair has not yet started.
    
3.  **Vehicle**: This button also calls the method `action_open_vehicle_details_wizard`. It seems to serve the same purpose as the 'Start Repair' button but is visible once the repair has started. That is, after the user clicks 'Start Repair' and the `is_started` field becomes `True`, the 'Start Repair' button disappears and the 'Vehicle' button becomes visible.
    
4.  **Customer**: When this button is clicked, it calls the method `action_open_customer_details_wizard` from the Python code. This likely opens another wizard for the user to enter or update customer-related information. This button is also only visible once the repair has started (when `is_started` is `True`).
    

This header section helps to manage the workflow of a repair job. Initially, the user can assign a technician if not already assigned, and then click on 'Start Repair' to input the vehicle details. Once the repair is started, the user will have the option to view/update the vehicle or customer details.

This view definition is for the Vehicle Details Wizard. It's a form that contains various fields about a vehicle including its image, brand, model, registration number, chassis number, etc. The fields are arranged in two columns with an image at the top. At the bottom, there are two buttons for saving or canceling the form. This form is likely displayed when the "Start Repair" or "Vehicle" button is clicked on the Job Card form.

Thank you for sharing the updated code. It looks like you have adjusted the padding to position the image in the desired location. The `padding` style property takes four values corresponding to the top, right, bottom, and left padding, respectively. You've set 10px padding at the top, 0px on the right and left, and 120px at the bottom. Additionally, you have also updated the size of the image to be 120x120 pixels.

This is how the updated code looks:

xml

```xml
<div class="header_image" style="text-align:center; padding: 10px 0px 120px 0px;">
    <field name="avatar" widget="image" class="oe_avatar" options="{'size': [120, 120]}" nolabel="1"/>
</div>
```

It's great to hear that this worked for your needs! Adjusting the styling is often necessary to achieve the exact layout and appearance you're looking for.

The last bracket `}` should not be there unless it's closing a previously opened block. The snippet you posted seems to be a part of a CSS file or a `<style>` block. In CSS, each block of style rules must be enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

It's possible that there is an opening curly brace `{` that corresponds to this closing brace `}` earlier in the file that is not shown in the snippet you posted.

If that's not the case, and this closing brace `}` does not correspond to any opening brace `{`,

> is this right its last one in the filr } .paginate\_button{ margin-right: 10px !important; } .job\_date\_class { width: 800px; // or any width you want }

It seems like there is an extra closing curly brace `}` at the start of the snippet you posted. The last rule `.job_date_class` is properly enclosed within curly braces `{}`. You should remove the extraneous closing curly brace at the beginning of the snippet.

Here's the corrected version:

css

```css
.paginate_button{
    margin-right: 10px !important;
}

.job_date_class {
    width: 800px; /* or any width you want */
}
```

Additionally, please note that I changed the `//` to `/* */` for the comment. In CSS, comments should be enclosed in `/* */` instead of using `//`.

> .job\_date\_class { width: 800px; // or any width you want } }

The snippet you posted has a syntax error. In CSS, comments should be enclosed in `/* */` instead of using `//`. Also, there's an extraneous closing curly brace at the end of the snippet. Here is the corrected version:

css

```css
.job_date_class {
    width: 800px; /* or any width you want */
}
```

This should work correctly.

> what about last bracket

The last curly brace `}` should not be there if there isn't an opening curly brace `{` that matches it before the `.job_date_class` rule.

If this snippet is part of a larger CSS file, then the last curly brace might have a matching opening curly brace earlier in the file. However, if the snippet is complete on its own, then the last curly brace should be removed, as shown in the corrected version:

css

```css
.job_date_class {
    width: 800px; /* or any width you want */
}
```

This makes the CSS valid and avoids any syntax errors.

To achieve the behavior you described, you can add another button to the VehicleDetailsWizard form view, and bind this button to a new function that saves the vehicle details and then opens the CustomerDetailsWizard.

Here's how you can modify the `vehicle.details.wizard` model to add a new method called `button_save_and_open_customer_details`:

python

```python
class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'

    # ... Existing fields here ...

    def button_save_and_open_customer_details(self):
        # First save vehicle details
        self.button_save_details()

        # Then open the Customer Details Wizard
        view_id = self.env.ref('your_module_name.customer_details_wizard_form_view').id # specify the xml_id of the customer wizard form view
        return {
            'name': 'Customer Details',
            'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
            'res_model': 'customer.details.wizard',
            'view_mode': 'form',
            'view_id': view_id,
            'target': 'new',
            'context': {
                'default_customer_id': self.env['job.card'].browse(self.env.context.get('active_id')).customer_id.id,
                'active_id': self.env.context.get('active_id')
            },
        }

    # ... Existing methods here ...
```

Next, update the XML file of the VehicleDetailsWizard form view and add the new button for opening the Customer Details Wizard:

xml

```xml
<record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
    <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <!-- Existing form fields here -->
            
            <footer>
                <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                <button string="Customer" type="object" class="btn-secondary" name="button_save_and_open_customer_details"/>
                <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
            </footer>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

This will add a new button labeled "Customer"

> I already have the customer wzard woring. I juts need a button and an action to call it

Okay, in that case, you only need to add the button to the VehicleDetailsWizard form view and create the function to open the CustomerDetailsWizard as shown above. I'll just focus on the changes you need to make:

1.  In your `vehicle.details.wizard` model:

python

```python
class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'

    # ... Existing fields here ...

    def button_open_customer_details(self):
        # First save vehicle details
        self.button_save_details()

        # Then open the Customer Details Wizard
        view_id = self.env.ref('your_module_name.customer_details_wizard_form_view').id # specify the xml_id of the customer wizard form view
        return {
            'name': 'Customer Details',
            'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
            'res_model': 'customer.details.wizard',
            'view_mode': 'form',
            'view_id': view_id,
            'target': 'new',
            'context': {
                'default_customer_id': self.env['job.card'].browse(self.env.context.get('active_id')).customer_id.id,
                'active_id': self.env.context.get('active_id')
            },
        }

    # ... Existing methods here ...
```

2.  Update the XML file of the VehicleDetailsWizard form view to add the new button:

xml

```xml
<record id="vehicle_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
    <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <!-- Existing form fields here -->
            
            <footer>
                <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                <button string="Customer" type="object" class="btn-secondary" name="button_open_customer_details"/>
                <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
            </footer>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

This will add a button labeled "Customer" in the footer of the Vehicle Details Wizard, which, when clicked, will save the vehicle details and open the Customer Details Wizard.

Make sure to replace `'your_module_name.customer_details_wizard_form_view'` with the correct xml\_id of the Customer Details Wizard form view.

> you know the module name

From the code you shared earlier, it seems that the module name is `'tk_vehicle_repair'`. Therefore, you should replace `'your_module_name.customer_details_wizard_form_view'` with the actual XML ID of the Customer Details Wizard form view in your module.

For example, if the XML ID of the Customer Details Wizard form view is `'customer_details_wizard_form_view'`, then you would replace the line:

python

```python
view_id = self.env.ref('your_module_name.customer_details_wizard_form_view').id
```

with:

python

```python
view_id = self.env.ref('tk_vehicle_repair.customer_details_wizard_form_view').id
```

This assumes that the Customer Details Wizard form view has been defined in the XML files of your `tk_vehicle_repair` module with an ID of `customer_details_wizard_form_view`. Make sure this matches the actual ID you have defined in your module's XML files.

> when I click on Customer from Vechile Wizard Only the name shows it does not show Phone or email

This behavior might be due to the fact that the form view for the Customer Details Wizard is not properly configured to display the fields for the phone and email.

You should check the XML file where the form view for the Customer Details Wizard is defined. Make sure that you include the fields for phone and email in the view.

Here is an example of what the XML should look like (make sure you adjust it to your actual field names and model):

xml

```xml
<record id="customer_details_wizard_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">customer.details.wizard.form</field>
    <field name="model">customer.details.wizard</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <group>
                <field name="customer_id"/>
                <field name="phone"/>
                <field name="email"/>
            </group>
            <footer>
                <!-- You can include buttons here, like save -->
            </footer>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

Ensure that the fields `"phone"` and `"email"` are included within the form view definition.

Also, make sure that in your Python code, the default values for the phone and email are being passed in the context when opening the Customer Details Wizard, similar to how it is done for the Vehicle Details Wizard.

> I have anotehr button Called Customer When I click that it shows the Phone and the Email coul I not have just called the customer action from the Customer button on Vechiele wizard

Yes, you can actually re-use the action method for the "Customer" button in the Vehicle Details Wizard. This will provide the same functionality and experience.

First, in the `vehicle.details.wizard` class, you can define another method, say `button_open_customer_details`:

python

```python
class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'
    
    # ... your other fields and methods ...

    def button_open_customer_details(self):
        # First, save the vehicle details if they have not been saved.
        self.button_save_details()
        
        # Now, use the action method of the "Customer" button.
        job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(self.env.context.get('active_id'))
        return job_card.action_open_customer_details_wizard()
```

Now in the XML file for the form view of the `vehicle.details.wizard`, add the new button:

xml

```xml
<button string="Customer" type="object" name="button_open_customer_details" class="btn-secondary"/>
```

This will use the existing action method for the "Customer" button. When you click the "Customer" button from the Vehicle Details Wizard, it will first save the vehicle details and then open the Customer Details Wizard.

Tutorial: Creating Wizards in Odoo
==================================

Wizards are popup dialogs used in Odoo to gather additional information or confirm actions. They are great for guiding users through complex tasks step-by-step. This tutorial will guide you through creating wizards using the example of a Vehicle Repair module.

Step 1: Define Wizard Models
----------------------------

First, create the Python classes for the wizards. For our example, let's create two wizards - one for vehicle details and another for customer details.

**Example:**

python

```python
# In your_module/models/wizards.py

from odoo import fields, models

# Wizard for Vehicle Details
class VehicleDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'vehicle.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Vehicle Details Wizard'

    # Fields for the vehicle wizard
    avatar = fields.Binary(string="Image")
    reg_no = fields.Char(string="Registration Number")
    # ...other fields...

    # Save button action
    def button_save_details(self):
        # Code to save details goes here
        # For example:
        active_id = self.env.context.get('active_id')
        if active_id:
            job_card = self.env['job.card'].browse(active_id)
            job_card.write({
                'avatar': self.avatar,
                'reg_no': self.reg_no,
                # ...other fields...
            })

# Wizard for Customer Details
class CustomerDetailsWizard(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'customer.details.wizard'
    _description = 'Customer Details Wizard'

    # Fields for the customer wizard
    customer_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    phone = fields.Char(string="Phone")
    # ...other fields...

    # Save button action
    def button_save_details(self):
        # Code to save customer details
```

Step 2: Create Wizard Views
---------------------------

Create the views for your wizards. This is where you design what your wizards will look like.

**Example:**

xml

```xml
<!-- In your_module/views/vehicle_details_wizard.xml -->

<!-- Vehicle Details Wizard -->
<record id="view_vehicle_details_wizard_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
    <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <!-- Fields for Vehicle Wizard -->
            <field name="avatar" widget="image"/>
            <field name="reg_no"/>
            <!-- ...other fields... -->
            <!-- Button to save details and open customer wizard -->
            <footer>
                <button string="Save" type="object" class="btn-primary" name="button_save_details"/>
                <button string="Open Customer" type="object" class="btn-secondary" name="button_open_customer_details"/>
                <button string="Cancel" class="btn-secondary" special="cancel"/>
            </footer>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

Step 3: Link Wizards to Buttons
-------------------------------

Now, link your wizards to buttons on your main form.

**Example:**

xml

```xml
<!-- In your_module/views/job_card_view.xml -->

<record id="view_job_card_form" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">job.card.form</field>
    <field name="model">job.card</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            <!-- ...existing fields... -->
            <!-- Button to open the vehicle details wizard -->
            <button string="Vehicle" type="object" name="action_open_vehicle_details_wizard" class="btn-secondary"/>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
```

**Example action method in Python:**

python

```python
# In your_module/models/job_card.py

from odoo import api, fields, models

class JobCard(models.Model):
    _name = 'job.card'
    # ...other fields...

    # Method to open the vehicle details wizard
    def action_open_vehicle_details_wizard(self):
        return {
            'name': 'Vehicle Details',
            'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
            'res_model': 'vehicle.details.wizard',
            'view_mode': 'form',
            'view_id': self.env.ref('your_module.view_vehicle_details_wizard_form').id,
            'target': 'new',
        }
```

And that's it! You have created two simple wizards for vehicle and customer details and linked them to buttons on your main form. These wizards can be used to guide users through the process of filling in complex data step by step.

> You forgot aboult adding views to Manifest file

You are correct. To ensure that Odoo recognizes the new views we have created for the wizards, we need to add them to the module's manifest file.

Step 4: Add Wizard Views to Manifest File
-----------------------------------------

Add the XML files containing the wizard views to the `data` section of the manifest file (`__manifest__.py` or `__openerp__.py`) of your module.

**Example:**

python

```python
# In your_module/__manifest__.py

{
    'name': 'Your Module',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Your Category',
    'description': 'Your module description',
    # ...other details...
    
    'data': [
        # ...other data files...
        
        # Add your wizard views here
        'views/vehicle_details_wizard.xml',
        # ...other views...
    ],
    # ...other sections...
}
```

After adding the views to the manifest file, you will need to update the module in the Odoo apps list for the changes to take effect.

This concludes the tutorial on creating wizards in Odoo. Through these steps, you've learned how to define wizard models, create wizard views, link them to buttons on your main form, and include them in your module's manifest file.

> I would like to add some Bootstrap to my forms in th ewizard how woud I do that. What woul dbe some goot bootsrapt is it libriaries ??

Adding Bootstrap to the forms in an Odoo wizard involves including Bootstrap's CSS and JS files and using Bootstrap's classes within the views.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Include Bootstrap Files
-------------------------------

You need to include Bootstrap's CSS and JS files. You can either download them and include them in your module, or you can link to them from a CDN.

Create an XML file (e.g., `assets.xml`) within your module to include these files.

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="your_module_assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <!-- Include Bootstrap CSS -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>

            <!-- Include Bootstrap JS and its dependencies -->
            <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
            <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
            <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

Include `assets.xml` in your module's manifest file:

python

```python
# In your_module/__manifest__.py
{
    # ...other details...
    'data': [
        # ...other data files...
        'views/assets.xml',
    ],
    # ...other sections...
}
```

Step 2: Use Bootstrap in Your Views
-----------------------------------

Once you've included Bootstrap, you can start using Bootstrap classes in your views. Here's an example of how you can use Bootstrap to style your wizard form view:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<odoo>
    <record id="view_vehicle_details_wizard_form" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
        <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <form class="container">
                <!-- Use Bootstrap classes -->
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <group>
                            <field name="vehicle_brand_id" class="form-control"/>
                            <field name="vehicle_model_id" class="form-control"/>
                            <!-- other fields -->
                        </group>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <group>
                            <field name="chassis_no" class="form-control"/>
                            <field name="vin_no" class="form-control"/>
                            <!-- other fields -->
                        </group>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <!-- buttons -->
            </form>
        </field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

Please note that Odoo has its own styling and components, and mixing Bootstrap with Odoo's default styles might sometimes lead to conflicts or unexpected results. It's good practice to test thoroughly to make sure everything looks and works as expected.

> im already using a theme from the ODOO 16 apps store Called code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise

If you are using a theme from the Odoo app store, it's likely that the theme already incorporates Bootstrap or a similar framework. In such cases, you don't need to include Bootstrap separately, as it might lead to conflicts.

To use the styling provided by the theme, you should refer to the documentation or guidelines provided by the theme developer. However, if the theme is based on Bootstrap, you can use Bootstrap classes directly in your views as shown in the previous example.

Keep in mind that the integration of a third-party theme might be different from the default Odoo styling. It is important to understand the structure and styling classes provided by the theme for the best results.

Here's a simplified example of how you can use Bootstrap classes within your form view if the theme is based on Bootstrap:

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<odoo>
    <record id="view_vehicle_details_wizard_form" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">vehicle.details.wizard.form</field>
        <field name="model">vehicle.details.wizard</field>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <form>
                <!-- Use Bootstrap classes -->
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <group>
                            <field name="vehicle_brand_id" class="form-control"/>
                            <field name="vehicle_model_id" class="form-control"/>
                            <!-- other fields -->

It is recommended to consult the documentation or contact the support of the theme developer if you encounter issues or need specific guidance regarding the theme you are using.

> I dont undertand how bootstratp works. Do I dowload the bootstrap I need locally the add the js files to the module. can ou explaing

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that helps in designing websites and web applications faster and easier. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels, and many other components, as well as optional JavaScript plugins.

Here's how you can include Bootstrap in an Odoo module:

1.  **Download Bootstrap**: Go to the Bootstrap website and download the latest version. You'll get a zip file.
    
2.  **Extract the Zip File**: Extract the contents of the zip file. You will see a folder structure with CSS and JS folders.
    
3.  **Include Bootstrap in your Odoo Module**: Create a static folder in your Odoo module. Inside the static folder, create a lib folder. Place the extracted CSS and JS folders of Bootstrap inside this lib folder.
    

vbnet

```vbnet
- your_module
    - static
        - lib
            - bootstrap
                - css
                - js
```

4.  **Link Bootstrap to Your Module**: Now, you need to tell Odoo to load the Bootstrap files. You do this by creating a QWeb view. Inside your module, create a folder named `views`. Inside this folder, create an XML file, e.g., `assets.xml`.

xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_backend" name="your_module assets" inherit_id="web.assets_backend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <!-- Include Bootstrap CSS -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/scss" href="/your_module/static/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
            <!-- Include Bootstrap JS -->
            <script type="text/javascript" src="/your_module/static/lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

5.  **Add assets.xml to your Module's `__manifest__.py`**: This step is important to ensure that Odoo knows about this new assets file.

python

```python
{
    ...
    'data': [
        'views/assets.xml',  # Add this line
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

6.  **Use Bootstrap in Your Views**: Now that Bootstrap is included in your module, you can use Bootstrap classes and components in your views.

xml

```xml
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            ...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

7.  **Restart and Upgrade**: Restart your Odoo instance and upgrade your module. Bootstrap should now be included in your module, and you can start using it to style your views.

Please note that since Odoo may already be using its own styling or another version of Bootstrap, there might be conflicts. Make sure to test your changes thoroughly and adjust the styling as needed.

> here is my maifest file 'assets': { 'web.assets\_backend': \[ "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/scss/theme\_accent.scss", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/scss/navigation\_bar.scss", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/scss/datetimepicker.scss", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/scss/theme.scss", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/js/fields/basic\_fields.js", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/js/chrome/sidebar.js", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/xml/top\_bar.xml", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/scss/sidebar.scss", "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/xml/sidebar.xml", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700&display=swap", \], 'web.assets\_frontend': \[ "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise/static/src/scss/login.scss", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700&display=swap",

From the manifest file you provided, it looks like the theme "code\_backend\_theme\_enterprise" already includes some SCSS, JavaScript, and XML files, as well as an external font from Google Fonts.

If you would like to add Bootstrap to this theme, you should follow the steps outlined in my previous message, but make sure to modify the theme's manifest file, instead of creating a new module.

Here is how you can include Bootstrap in the `code_backend_theme_enterprise` theme by modifying the manifest file:

1.  Download and place the Bootstrap files in the static directory of the `code_backend_theme_enterprise` theme as mentioned in the previous message.
    
2.  Modify the 'assets' section of the manifest file to include the Bootstrap files. The modified 'assets' section might look like this:
    

python

```python
'assets': {
    'web.assets_backend': [
        "code_backend_theme_enterprise/static/src/scss/theme_accent.scss",
        "code_backend_theme_enterprise/static/src/scss/navigation_bar.scss",
        ...
        "code_backend_theme_enterprise/static/src/scss/sidebar.scss",
        "code_backend_theme_enterprise/static/src/xml/sidebar.xml",
        "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700&display=swap",
        
        # Add these lines to include Bootstrap
        "code_backend_theme_enterprise/static/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css",
        "code_backend_theme_enterprise/static/lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js",
    ],
    'web.assets_frontend': [
        ...
    ],
}
```

3.  Restart your Odoo instance and update the theme.

Please note that including Bootstrap might affect the existing styles of the theme. You might need to make additional customizations to make sure Bootstrap and the theme's styles work well together.

> where can i download bootstrap

You can download Bootstrap from its official website: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

To download Bootstrap, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/).
    
2.  Click on "Get started" button or visit [this link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/).
    
3.  There you will see different options for downloading Bootstrap. You can download the compiled CSS and JS, or the source files. For most cases, the compiled version is sufficient. Click the "Download" button under "Compiled CSS and JS" section.
    
4.  Once downloaded, you will get a zip file named something like `bootstrap-5.x.x-dist.zip`. Extract this zip file.
    
5.  Inside the extracted folder, you will find CSS and JS directories. You can place these directories in the `static` directory of your Odoo module or theme as mentioned in my previous message.
    

As an alternative, you can also link to Bootstrap through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) which allows you to include Bootstrap in your project without downloading it locally. This is how it can be done:

Include these lines in your Odoo module's or theme's assets section.

For CSS:

xml

```xml
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

For JS:

xml

```xml
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.10.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Note: Replace `5.2.0` with the version number you want to use, or remove the version number to always use the latest version.

> when updating the module I get this The operation cannot be completed: another model requires the record being deleted. If possible, archive it instead. Model: Vehicle Job Card (job.card) Constraint: job\_card\_technician\_id\_fkey

This error indicates that you're trying to update or delete a record that is being referenced by another model through a foreign key constraint. This often happens when you try to delete a record that is being used in a relationship (e.g., a One2many or Many2one relationship) with another record.

There are a few ways to address this issue:

1.  **Check if you can archive the record instead of deleting it.** Archiving a record usually means setting an `active` field to `False`. This way, the record will be hidden in most views but will still exist in the database.
    
2.  **Delete or update the related records first.** Before deleting a record, ensure that no other records are referencing it. You might need to either delete the related records or update them to reference a different record.
    
3.  **Update the module definition or the relation.** If you are modifying the structure of the models (e.g., fields, relationships) make sure that you are not removing a field or relationship that is crucial for the integrity of the data.
    

In your specific case, it seems like the model `job.card` has a foreign key constraint (`job_card_technician_id_fkey`). This probably means that there is a Many2one relationship with another model, probably technicians. You should make sure that no `job.card` record is referencing a technician that you are trying to delete or update.

If you are sure about what you're doing and understand the consequences, you can use the Odoo shell or

> I dont want to delete anything I am juts ugrading the module for the wizards

If you are just updating the module and not intending to delete any records, it's possible that there might be some changes in the relationships between models, or changes in constraints that are causing this issue.

Here are steps to troubleshoot:

1.  **Review the Changes**: Check if there are any changes related to relationships such as Many2one, One2many, or ForeignKey constraints in the Python models (`.py` files) or the XML data files. Make sure the relationships are defined correctly.
    
2.  **Update Relationships Properly**: If there are any new relationships introduced or old ones being altered, make sure they are updated in a way that they don’t break existing data. For example, if you are changing a Many2one relationship, make sure that the records are updated properly.
    
3.  **Update the Data Files**: Sometimes the error might be due to incorrect data in XML files. Make sure that the `.xml` files don’t contain any records that might conflict with the existing data in the database.
    
4.  **Update Constraints**: If there are any changes in the SQL constraints in the models, make sure that they are compatible with the existing data.
    
5.  **Log Information**: Sometimes the error message might not be enough to understand the root cause. It’s a good practice to look into the Odoo server logs to get more information about what’s causing the error. The logs can sometimes give you the exact record that is causing the issue.
    
6.  **Database Backups and Testing**: Before making any changes or updating modules in a production environment, it's highly recommended to backup your database. Also, if possible, test the update in a staging or development environment first. This allows you to address any issues without affecting the live system.
    
7.  **Module Dependencies**: Sometimes updating one module might affect another due to dependencies. Ensure that all dependent modules are compatible with each other.
    

Remember to proceed with caution, especially if you are working on a production database. Always have a backup before making changes,

> I will come back to bootstrap when al login is working in my project. Back to the vechile project now. On the vechile wizard page we have an image avatar. this image contains a Car registration image. I want to use PaddleOCR which I have setup on another server with Docker to convrt the image to a text value so I can auto fill in the Registration Number. Do you understandin the logic I am trying to do? Before we get into code lets discuss If PaddleOCR on a seperate server is a ggod idea. My thinking is I already have ODOO setup on my baremetal server. I dont want to use DOCKER for production servers. I dont want to go start installing PADDLE on the smae server as ODOO incase I mess ODOO up with python versions etc. So my think is setup Paddleocr which they reccomend to use Docker which I have setup on my portainer port.softcroft.ie, Is it good devolopment practive to have Paddleocr for ecample on a sepertae server. This will be used in Production or would just installing Paddleocr on the same server as ODOO. Please list pros and cons. WHat would you reccomend. I plan on selling the vechile to many meachains so this will be used by many users. Each mechain with ODOO install but using the pADDLEOCR docker. Does this make sense

Using PaddleOCR on a separate server can be a good idea depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. Here are the pros and cons of both approaches:

PaddleOCR on a Separate Server
------------------------------

### Pros:

1.  **Isolation**: Keeping PaddleOCR on a separate server means that any issues or crashes with PaddleOCR won't affect your main Odoo server. This is especially beneficial when you want to ensure that the primary application remains stable.
    
2.  **Scalability**: If the OCR service is being heavily used, you can independently scale the OCR service without affecting the Odoo server.
    
3.  **Version Compatibility**: As you mentioned, there won't be conflicts between Python versions or other dependencies between Odoo and PaddleOCR.
    
4.  **Resource Allocation**: OCR processing can be resource-intensive. Keeping it on a separate server means that it won't take resources away from your Odoo server.
    

### Cons:

1.  **Increased Complexity**: Managing multiple servers can be more complex, especially when it comes to networking and security configurations.
    
2.  **Latency**: Since the OCR processing is done on a different server, the network latency might slightly delay the processing time compared to running it locally.
    
3.  **Cost**: Depending on your hosting solution, having an additional server might incur extra costs.
    

PaddleOCR on the Same Server
----------------------------

### Pros:

1.  **Simplicity**: Having everything on one server is simpler to set up and manage.
    
2.  **Lower Latency**: Since the OCR processing and the Odoo server are on the same machine, the communication between them would be faster compared to having them on separate servers.
    
3.  **Cost Savings**: You won't need to incur the additional cost of maintaining a separate server.
    

### Cons:

1.  **Resource Contention**: OCR processing could be resource-intensive and might slow down the Odoo server if they are not properly isolated.
    
2.  **Potential Dependency Conflicts**: As you mentioned, there can be conflicts between Python versions or other dependencies.
    
3.  **Risk of Crashes**: If PaddleOCR encounters an issue that causes it to crash, it might also affect the Odoo server.
    

Recommendation:
---------------

Given the scale of your project (planning to sell the vehicle module to many mechanics), and considering the need for isolation, scalability, and avoiding dependency conflicts, it seems like a good idea to keep PaddleOCR on a separate server. This will also allow you to potentially optimize the PaddleOCR server specifically for OCR tasks, and ensure that the Odoo server's resources are dedicated to serving the Odoo application. You can mitigate the cons of having a separate server by using automation and monitoring tools to manage the servers efficiently.
